<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the <b>spoken tutorial</b> on <b>Setting Pop-up and Image options</b> in <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:12
In this tutorial, we will learn: * How to set <b>Pop-up</b> and <b>image preferences</b>.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Customize <b>Toolbar</b>.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
<b>Pop-up window</b>s or pop-ups are <b>windows</b> that appear automatically without your permission.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
They vary in size but usually don't cover the whole screen.

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:36
Some pop-ups open on top of the current <b>Firefox window</b> while others appear underneath Firefox (pop-unders).

7
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
Pop-ups can be quite irritating and that’s why we want to disable them.

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
In this tutorial, we are using <b>Firefox version 7.0</b> on <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
Let us open a Firefox browser.

10
00:00:53 --> 00:01:00
In the <b>URL bar</b>, let us type ‘w w w dot pop up test dot com’.

11
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
Press the <b>Enter</b> key.

12
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
This site shows you what a pop-up is.

13
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
Click on the <b>link</b> that says ‘Multi-PopUp Test’.

14
00:01:12 --> 00:01:19
You will see 6 pop-ups.

15
00:01:20 --> 00:01:21
Click on <b>Back</b>.

16
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
2 more pop-ups appear. See how irritating they are?

17
00:01:28 --> 00:01:36
Firefox allows you to control both <b>pop-up</b>s and <b>pop-under</b>s.  This is done by clicking on <b>Edit</b> and then <b>Preferences</b>.

18
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
<b>Windows</b> users, please click on <b>Tools</b> and then on <b>Options</b>.

19
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
In the <b>Preferences</b> window, click on the <b>Content</b> tab.

20
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
The <b>Block pop-up windows</b> option is already turned on, by default.

21
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
If not, then you need to check it.

22
00:01:56 --> 00:02:01
So, you don't have to worry about enabling it to prevent pop-ups from appearing in Firefox.

23
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
Now you can close the Firefox <b>Preference</b> window by clicking on the <b>Close</b> button.

24
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
You can also choose <b>exceptions</b>.

25
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
Exceptions are sites whose pop-ups are acceptable to you.

26
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Click on <b>Edit</b> and then <b>Preferences</b>.

27
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
<b>Windows</b> users, please click on <b>Tools</b> and then on <b>Options</b>.

28
00:02:26 --> 00:02:33
In order to add exceptions, click on the <b>Exceptions</b> button next to the field <b>Block pop-up windows</b>.

29
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
This opens up a dialog box.

30
00:02:37 --> 00:02:43
In the <b>Address of website</b> field, type: ‘w w w dot google dot com’.

31
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
Click on the <b>Allow</b> button.

32
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Click <b>Close</b> to close the dialog box.

33
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
Click <b>Close</b> to close the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.

34
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
Now pop-ups will be disallowed from all sites except from 'google.com'.

35
00:03:01 --> 00:03:08
Now in the URL bar, type: ‘w w w dot pop up test dot com’ and press <b>Enter</b>.

36
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
Click on the link '<b>Multi-PopUp Test'</b>.

37
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Not a single pop-up has appeared.

38
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
Your pop-up blocker is effective!

39
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
Images take time and bandwidth to download.

40
00:03:24 --> 00:03:29
Mozilla Firefox has an option to selectively stop the downloading of images.

41
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Click on <b>Edit</b> and then <b>Preferences</b>.

42
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
<b>Windows</b> users, please click on <b>Tools</b> and then on <b>Options</b>.

43
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
In the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box, choose the <b>Content</b> tab.

44
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
Disable the check-box for <b>Load images automatically</b>.

45
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Click on <b>Close</b> to close the dialog box.

46
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
Now, in the <b>Search bar</b>, let us type "Flowers" and press the <b>Enter</b> key.

47
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
From the 'google' <b>home page</b>, click on <b>Images</b>.

48
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
click on the first image link that appears.

49
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
You see that the image does not <b>load</b>.

50
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
Mozilla Firefox offers a number of options to customize the toolbars.

51
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
Let’s say we want to hide any toolbar. For example, the Menu bar.

52
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
Right-click on an empty section of the Menu bar.

53
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
And uncheck it.
<p>That's it! 
</p>

54
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
To view the the Menu bar again right-click on an empty section of the toolbar again.

55
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Now check the Menu bar option.

56
00:04:40 --> 00:04:45
Firefox offers advanced options to customize the toolbars. Let's look at some.

57
00:04:46 --> 00:04:53
Let us add an icon to the Toolbar which will allow us to print a web-page with a single click.

58
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Right-click on an empty section of the Toolbar.

59
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
Click on <b>Customize</b>.

60
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
The <b>Customize Toolbar</b> dialog box appears.

61
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
Within the dialog box, you can see the <b>Print</b> icon.

62
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
Drag the icon onto the Toolbar.

63
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
Close the dialog box by clicking on <b>Done</b>.

64
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
Click on the <b>Print</b> icon in the Toolbar.

65
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
This brings up the <b>Print</b> dialog box.

66
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
We will not be printing now.

67
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
So, click on <b>Cancel</b> to close the dialog box.

68
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
You can also add or remove toolbars.

69
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
To do so, right-click on the Toolbar and select <b>Customize</b>.

70
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
Click on <b>Add New Toolbar</b> button.

71
00:05:44 --> 00:05:49
Enter a name for the new toolbar. Let’s name it <b>Sample Toolbar</b>.

72
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Click on <b>OK</b> button.

73
00:05:53 --> 00:06:00
Now drag and drop an icon, say Downloads, onto the <b>Sample Toolbar</b>.

74
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Notice the new <b>Toolbar</b> in the browser.

75
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
To remove a toolbar, click on <b>Restore Default Set</b> button.

76
00:06:10 --> 00:06:15
In order to maximize the contents area, we can reduce the size of the icons.

77
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
Check on the check-box titled <b>"Use Small icons"</b>.

78
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
Click <b>Done</b> to close the dialog box.

79
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
We see that the size of the icons has become smaller.

80
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

81
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
In this tutorial, we learnt how to: Set Pop-up and Image preferences.
