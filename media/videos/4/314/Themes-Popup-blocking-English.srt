00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Now, let us choose another theme.

39
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
This theme displays <b>Add to Firefox </b>button.

40
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04

00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
Click on any <b>Persona </b>of your choice.

00:05:01 --> 00:05:05

00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
Often 'ads' interfere with our internet experience.

74
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
But there are specialized software that help to block ads.

75
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
One such add-on is <b>Adblock</b>.

76
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
Click on <b>Tools </b>and then on <b>Add-ons</b>.

77
00:05:43 --> 00:05:50
In the search  tab, at the top-right corner, search for <b>Adblock.</b>Press <b>Enter</b>.

78
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
A list of 'Ad' blocking software is displayed.

79
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
Click on the <b>Install </b>button for <b>Adblock Plus</b>.

80
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
'Adblock' starts downloading.

81
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
That's it! <b>Ad blocker</b> is now installed.

82
00:06:06 --> 00:06:13
A notification message will be displayed which says- <b>“Adblock will be installed after you restart Firefox”</b>.

83
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
Click on the <b>Restart Now </b>link.

84
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
<b>Mozilla Firefox</b> will shut down and restart.

85
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
When it restarts, the <b>ad blocker</b> will take effect.

86
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
However, using <b>ad blocker</b>s have some negative consequences.

87
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
Some sites do not allow you to enter them when <b>ad blocker</b> is on.

88
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
This is because many free sites earn their income from 'ads'.

89
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
Adblocker may prevent some sites from being displayed on your browser.

90
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
This factor has to be considered carefully when blocking <b>ads</b>.

91
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

92
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
