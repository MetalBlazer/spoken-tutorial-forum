Here, we are using <b>Firefox 7.0</b> on <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

4
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Let us open the Firefox browser.

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
By default, the <b>"yahoo" home page</b> opens.

6
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
Now, let's learn about searching for links in Firefox.

7
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
Firefox allows you to search for and find <b>links</b> within a web-page.

8
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
In the <b>Address bar</b>, type: <b>www. Google.co.in</b>  and press <b>Enter</b>.

9
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
Notice that the cursor is now placed inside the <b>Google search bar</b>.

00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
Next, click  the cursor any where on the page outside the search bar.

11
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
Now from the keyboard, press the <b>apostrophe</b> key.

12
00:01:09 --> 00:01:15
The <b>Quick Find links only</b>  search box appears at the bottom left corner of the window.

Inside this box, let's type <i>Bengali</i>. Notice that the link <i>Bengali</i> is highlighted.

14
00:01:25 --> 00:01:30
You can now search  quickly and easily for links within a web page.

15
00:01:31 --> 00:01:42
Suppose, you want to access the  Firefox browser with your settings and preferences from any other computer or device, like your mobile phone, will that be possible?

16
00:01:43 --> 00:01:54
Yes! The <b>Firefox Sync</b> feature stores all your browser data like- <b>bookmarks, history</b> and installed <b>extensions</b> securely on a <b>Mozilla server</b>.

17
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
You can <b>Sync</b> other computers to this <b>server</b> and so you can access your browser data.

00:07:04 --> 00:07:09
Plug-ins integrate third party programs into the Firefox browser.

70
00:07:10 --> 00:07:20
Plug-ins let you play <b>videos</b>, view multi-media content, perform virus scans and 'power animation in firefox'.

71
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
For e.g: <b>Flash</b> is a plug-in you installed to view videos in the Firefox browser.

72
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
Let's view the plug-ins that are installed in Firefox.

73
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37

74
00:07:38 --> 00:07:44

00:07:45 --> 00:07:49

76
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
And how do you install plug-ins?

77
00:07:53 --> 00:08:00
Each plug-in has to be downloaded from the relevant website  and then installed on your computer.

78
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
The installation procedure may be different for each plug-in.

79
00:08:05 --> 00:08:15
