00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on the <b>Mozilla Firefox Interface and Toolbars</b>.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
In this tutorial, we will learn about the <b>Firefox interface</b> and the <b>toolbars</b>.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:18
In this tutorial, we will use <b>Firefox version 7.0</b> for <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
Let’s now take a look at the Firefox interface.

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
Firefox has all the features that a modern browser needs to have.

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
To learn how to use Mozilla Firefox effectively, one should be familiar with each of its features.

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
The Mozilla Firefox interface can be split up into 6 distinct areas, namely-

8
00:00:41 --> 00:00:52
The <b>Menu bar</b>, the <b>Navigation toolbar</b>, the <b>Bookmarks</b> bar, the <b>Side bar</b>, the <b>Status bar</b>, and the <b>Content area</b>.

9
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
Let’s look at each of these and learn what it does.

10
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
Let's click on the <b>File</b> menu and click on <b>New Window</b>.

11
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
A new <b>window</b> pops up.

12
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
Some people have trouble looking at small script in their browser.

13
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
So, let's zoom into the page by clicking on <b>View > Zoom</b> and <b>Zoom In</b>.

14
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
Alternately, you can press <b>Ctrl + +</b>.

15
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
This will make the text bigger.

16
00:01:21 --> 00:01:26
To know which version of Mozilla Firefox you are using, click on <b>Help</b> and <b>About Firefox</b>.

17
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
By default, Firefox displays a <b>Homepage</b>.

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
But, to set your own preferred webpage as <b>Homepage</b>, click on <b>Edit</b> and <b>Preferences</b>.

19
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
<b>Windows</b> users please click on <b>Tools</b> and <b>Options</b>.

20
00:01:42 --> 00:01:51
In the <b>General</b> tab, click on <b>Home Page</b> field and type: ‘www.yahoo.com’ or any of your preferred webpage.

21
00:01:52 --> 00:01:59
Now you can close <b>Firefox Preferences</b> window by clicking the <b>Close</b> button on the bottom right hand corner.

22
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
You can use the <b>Edit</b> menu to search for particular words within the webpage.

23
00:02:05 --> 00:02:11
In the address bar, type: ‘www.google.com’

24
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Click on <b>Edit</b> and <b>Find</b>.

25
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
A small toolbar appears at the bottom of the <b>browser window</b>.

26
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
In the textbox, type the word ‘Gujarati’.

27
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
You will observe that the word ‘Gujarati’ on the page gets highlighted.

28
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
This function is very useful when searching through large text on a webpage.

29
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
Let's close this.

30
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
As the name suggests, the <b>Navigation toolbar</b> helps you navigate through the internet.

31
00:02:41 --> 00:02:47
The <b>Navigation bar</b> is the large text box where you type the address of the webpage that you want to visit.

32
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
It is called the <b>URL bar</b> or <b>Address bar</b>.

33
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
Click on the URL and delete the <b>address</b> that is already there.

34
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
Now, type: ‘www.google.com’.

35
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
Press the <b>Enter</b> key.You will now be in the <b>Google Homepage</b>.

36
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
Clicking on the 'back-arrow' icon will take you back to the page where you were before.

37
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
Click on the forward arrow to go back to the <b>Google homepage</b>.

38
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
To the right of the URL bar, is an <b>icon</b> shaped like a house.

39
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
This button takes you back to the <b>default home page</b> from whichever webpage you are on.

40
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
This function is useful when you are browsing from a particular site or a <b>search engine</b>.

41
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
Let's click on the <b>homepage</b> button.

42
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
Remember, we changed the 'home page' to ‘www.yahoo.com’ earlier on.

43
00:03:42 --> 00:03:48
As a result, clicking on the <b>homepage</b> button brings us to the "yahoo" homepage.

44
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
Now let's look at the <b>Bookmarks</b> bar.

45
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
'Bookmarks' help you navigate to <b>pages</b> that you visit or refer to often.

46
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
In the URL bar, type: ‘www.gmail.com’.

47
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
Once the page loads, click on the star symbol to the right of the URL bar.

48
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
You see that the star turns yellow.

49
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
Click on the star again.A dialog box pops up.

50
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
From the ‘Folder’ drop down menu, choose 'Bookmarks toolbar'.

51
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
Observe that the 'Gmail' bookmark is now added to the <b>Bookmarks toolbar</b>.

52
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
Click on the <b>Homepage</b> icon to go to the "yahoo" homepage.

53
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
Click on the 'Gmail'  <b>bookmark</b>.  This will direct you to the <b>Gmail  login page</b>.

54
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
You can use the <b>bookmarks bar</b> for sites which you visit often but don’t want to have as your <b>homepage</b>.

55
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
Next we will look at the <b>Sidebar</b>.

56
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
Click on <b>View</b> and <b>Sidebar</b> and then click on <b>History</b>.

57
00:04:54 --> 00:05:01
You see that the bar on the left side now has 3 options - <b>Today, Yesterday</b> and <b>Older than 6 months</b>.

58
00:05:02 --> 00:05:08
The displayed option is subject to the intervals between the usage of Firefox on that computer.

59
00:05:09 --> 00:05:14
Click on the plus sign, next to the <b>Today</b> icon, to expand the <b>menu</b>.

60
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
Choose the "google" link to be directed back to the <b>google homepage</b>.

61
00:05:19 --> 00:05:24
See how easy it is to go back to the site that you visited before!

62
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
The <b>Sidebar</b> even has a <b>Search</b> function of its own.

63
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
You can type in the name of the <b>site</b> that you want to search for, in the search box.

64
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
This will then search through your <b>history</b> to find it.

65
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
In the <b>search box</b>, type: "google".

66
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
The "google" <b>homepage</b> comes up as the first result.

67
00:05:43 --> 00:05:50
You can make the <b>Sidebar</b> disappear by clicking the small ‘x’ on the top right hand corner of the side bar.

68
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Next, let's see what the <b>Status bar</b> does.

69
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
The <b>Status bar</b> is the area at the bottom of your <b>browser window</b> that shows you the status of the site you are loading.

70
00:06:02 --> 00:06:09
Go to the <b>URL bar</b> and type: ‘www.wired.com’ and press <b>Enter</b> key.

71
00:06:10 --> 00:06:15
Look at the <b>Status bar</b> quickly. It shows you the status of the loading of that  webpage.

72
00:06:16 --> 00:06:24
The <b>Status bar</b> can help you to understand why a particular <b>site</b> is not loading, the time it may take to load etc.

73
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Finally, let's look at the <b>Content</b> area.

74
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
This is where you see the contents of the webpage you are viewing.

75
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
