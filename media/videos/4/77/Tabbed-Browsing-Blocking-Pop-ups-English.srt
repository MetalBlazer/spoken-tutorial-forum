<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to this <b>Spoken tutorial</b> of <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:12
In this tutorial, we will learn about: <b>Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop-ups</b>.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:20
In this tutorial, we will use <b>Firefox version 7.0</b> on <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

4
00:00:21 --> 00:00:28
Mozilla Firefox allows you to <b>load</b> multiple web pages into separate tabs within the same <b>browser window</b>.

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
The biggest advantage of <b>tabbed browsing</b> is that it eliminates the need to display multiple browser windows.

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
And hence it helps to keep your desktop clutter-free.

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
Each tab occupies the browser's entire viewing area when displayed.

8
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
It eliminates the need to frequently resize and reposition the opened browser windows.

9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:59
<b>Tabbed browsing</b> also consumes less memory and operating system resources than <b>tiled-window browsing</b>

10
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
provided the user does not open too many tabs at once.

11
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
Let's say, you are on a particular webpage.

12
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
Here is a link - “Firefox for Desktop”.

13
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
You can open this link in a new tab.

14
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
To do so, right-click on the link.

15
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
In the context menu, click on <b>Open link in new tab</b>.

16
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
You notice that a new tab opens to the right of the existing tab, in the same browser window.

17
00:01:28 --> 00:01:33
So, without closing or moving out of your window, you can open another webpage in the same window.

18
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
You can also open a new tab by clicking on <b>File</b> and <b>New Tab</b>.

19
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
The shortcut keys for this are <b>Ctrl+T</b>.

20
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
Notice that when you open a new tab, the new tab immediately becomes active.

21
00:01:50 --> 00:01:55
Now go to the <b>URL bar</b> and type: ‘www.google.com’.

22
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
You will now have 3 tabs, each with a different web page!

23
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
You can also open a new tab by clicking the ‘+’  button to the right of the rightmost tab.

24
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
We can also arrange  the tabs as per our requirements.

25
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
Just click on a tab and without releasing the <b>mouse button</b>, move it to the required location.

26
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Now release the 'mouse button'.

27
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
The tab is now in the desired location.

28
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28
Let us look at some basic operations which Mozilla Firefox allows us to perform.

29
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
Let us change the search engine to “google”.

30
00:02:32 --> 00:02:39
In the <b>Search bar</b> type: ‘email wikipedia’ and click on the magnifying glass to the right of the 'Search bar'.

31
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
The relevant Wikipedia page is the first search result.

32
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Let's open this page by clicking on the link.

33
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
Now, click on <b>File</b> and then on <b>“Save Page As”</b>.

34
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
Let's save the file on the Desktop with the name ‘Search.html’.

35
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
Now, let us open a new tab in the browser window by clicking on <b>File</b> and <b>New Tab</b>.

36
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
Now, let's open our saved page in this new <b>Tab window</b>.

37
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
Click on <b>File</b> and <b>Open File</b> .

38
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
Browse and open the saved file.

39
00:03:17 --> 00:03:24
In the URL bar, you see that the address is not an internet address but a local location on your computer.

40
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Now you can read this page, even when you are offline.

41
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
<b>Pop-ups</b> are windows that appear automatically without your permission.

42
00:03:34 --> 00:03:41
Firefox allows us to control both pop-ups and pop-unders through the <b>Content</b> tab within <b>Preferences</b> window.

43
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
On 'Windows', this would be within the <b>Options</b> window.

44
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Pop-up blocking is turned on, by default.

45
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
Click on <b>Edit</b> and <b>Preferences</b>.

46
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
<b>Windows</b> users please click on <b>Tools</b> and <b>Options</b>.

47
00:03:56 --> 00:04:01
In the <b>Content</b> tab, the first option <b>Block pop-up windows</b> is checked, by default.

48
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
If not, then please check this option.

49
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
The various options of this dialog box will be discussed in another tutorial.

50
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
Click on the <b>Close</b> button.

51
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

52
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
