00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on the <b>Mozilla Firefox - Search and Auto-complete features</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:14
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use <b>Search</b>, manage <b>Search Engines</b>, use the <b>Find bar</b>,

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
use <b>Auto-complete</b> in the <b>Address bar</b>.

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
In this tutorial, we will use <b>Firefox version 7.0</b> on <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
One of the most common things people do on the internet is to search for information.

6
00:00:31 --> 00:00:36
One can search for a specific website or for some other information.

7
00:00:37 --> 00:00:43
Mozilla Firefox has a number of functionalities that make it easy to search for information on the Internet.

8
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
Let’s look at some of the ways.

9
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
One way is to search by visiting other websites.

10
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
After all, <b>search engines</b> are websites too!

11
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
In the <b>URL bar</b>, type: ‘www.google.com’.

12
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
The <b>google home page</b> comes up.

13
00:01:01 --> 00:01:06
In the search box  of the google home page, type: ‘email’ and click <b>Search</b>.

14
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
The search engine brings up all the results.

15
00:01:10 --> 00:01:15
We see that the top result is for <b>g mail</b>, the email from 'google'.

16
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
But, there is an easier way to do the same thing with Mozilla Firefox.

17
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
Next to the 'URL bar' on the navigation toolbar, there is a <b>Search bar</b> <b>field</b>.

18
00:01:26 --> 00:01:32
Alternately, you can press <b>Ctrl+K</b> to directly go to the <b>Search bar</b>  field.

19
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
Click on the search bar and type ‘email’.

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Click the magnifying glass icon that is next to it.

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
We will see the results of the search in the contents area.

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
We see that the top result is for 'gmail', the email from 'google'.

23
00:01:50 --> 00:01:57
On the left side of the 'Search bar', the logo of the search engine which has been used to bring up the results is seen.

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
The default search engine used in Mozilla Firefox is ‘google’.

25
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
But, we need not be constrained by this. We can choose the search engine of our choice.

26
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Click on the google’s search engine logo within the <b>Search bar</b>.

27
00:02:12 --> 00:02:20
We notice that a drop-down box appears with the logos of most popular search engines including “Yahoo” and “Bing”.

28
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Select “Yahoo” from the drop-down box.

29
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
We observe that the logo on the left of the search bar has now changed to the “Yahoo” logo.

30
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
Now, let's  type ‘email’ again in the 'Search bar' and click the magnifying glass.

31
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
This time we see that the results in the <b>Contents area</b> are from the <b>“Yahoo” search engine</b>.

32
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
Observe that the results are slightly different from last time.

33
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
The top result is no longer 'gmail'. Instead, the top result is “Yahoo” mail.

34
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
Click on the search engine logo within the 'Search bar' again.

35
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
In the drop-down box,  select <b>Manage Search Engines</b>.

36
00:03:01 --> 00:03:06
This opens a dialog box entitled ‘Manage Search Engine List'.

37
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Click on the last item in the list.

38
00:03:10 --> 00:03:15
The buttons on the right side are now enabled. Click on the <b>Remove</b> button.

39
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
We see that the item we chose is no longer on the list.

40
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
Click on <b>OK</b> to close the dialog box.

41
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
Click on the <b>search engine logo</b> within the 'Search bar' again.

42
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
Click on “Manage Search Engines”.

43
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
The “Manage Search Engines List" dialog box pops up.

44
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
At the bottom of the dialog is a link that says ‘Get more search engines…’.

45
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
Click on it.A new browser tab opens.

46
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
It displays a number of search engines that we can add to the search bar.

47
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
You can add any of the 'search engines' according to your requirement.

48
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
Let's close this tab by clicking on the 'x' at the corner of the tab.

49
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
We can find specific text which is within the <b>Contents area</b> with the help of the <b>Find bar</b>.

50
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
In the URL bar, type: ‘www.gmail.com’ and press <b>Enter</b>.

51
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
When the 'gmail home page' has loaded, click on <b>Edit</b> and then on <b>Find</b>.

52
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
A <b>Find bar</b> appears at the bottom of the <b>browser window</b>.

53
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27
In the text box of the “Find bar”, type: ‘gmail’.

54
00:04:28 --> 00:04:35
As we type, we see that the first instance of that text is being highlighted in the <b>Contents area</b>.

55
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
Clicking on <b>Next</b> will move the focus to the next instance of the word.

56
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
Clicking on <b>Previous</b> will move the focus to the previous instance of the word.

57
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
Click on <b>Highlight all</b> option.

58
00:04:49 --> 00:04:55
We see that all instances of the search text are highlighted in the <b>Contents area</b>.

59
00:04:56 --> 00:05:03
Mozilla Firefox makes it easy to type web addresses in the 'URL bar' with its <b>auto-complete</b> function.

60
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
We don’t have to type the entire web address in the address bar.

61
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Try this: In the 'address bar', type: ‘gma’.

62
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
We see that Mozilla Firefox tries to auto-complete the word we are typing.

63
00:05:17 --> 00:05:22
It brings up a drop-down list with websites that start with ‘gma’.

64
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Choose the ‘gmail’ link from the drop-down list.

65
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
The ‘gmail’ webpage loads in the 'Contents area'.

66
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
If we do not like this feature, we can turn it off.

67
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Click on <b>Edit</b> and then on <b>Preferences</b>.

68
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
<b>Windows</b> users can click on <b>Tools</b> and then on <b>Options</b>.

69
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
Choose the <b>Privacy</b> tab from the list of main-menu tabs.

70
00:05:46 --> 00:05:52
At the very bottom of the dialog box, is an option named ‘When using the location bar, suggest’.

71
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Click on the arrow of  the drop-down list to expand it.

72
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
Select '<b>Nothing'</b> from the list.

73
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
Click on <b>‘Close’</b> to close the dialog box.

74
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
Let's go back to the 'address bar' and type ‘gma’. Notice that no suggestions come up.
