00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Organizing Bookmarks and Printing </b>in <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
In this tutorial, we will learn about <b>Bookmarks</b>.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
We will also learn how to: Organize Bookmarks, set up the Firefox page, Preview  and  Print it.

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
Here we are using <b>Firefox 7.0</b> on <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Let us open the <b>Firefox browser</b>.

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
By default, the yahoo <b>home page</b> opens.

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
<b>Bookmarks</b> help you navigate to <b>page</b>s that you use often.

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
We had learnt a little bit about <b>Bookmarks</b> in an earlier tutorial.

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
We had also added a bookmark for <b>gmail </b>there.

10
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
Let’s click on this to open the <b>gmail home page</b>.

11
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
You are directed to the <b>gmail home page</b>.

12
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
Did you notice the yellow star on the right of the <b>gmail </b>address, in the <b>Address </b>bar?

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
This indicates that this site has been bookmarked.

14
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
You can also use the star to change the name of a bookmark and store it in a different folder.

15
00:01:09 --> 00:01:17
Let’s change the name of <b>gmail </b>to <b>mygmailpage </b>and store it in a new folder named <b>MyNewBookmarks</b>.

16
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
In the <b>Address </b>bar, click on the yellow star.

17
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
The <b>Edit This Bookmark</b> dialog box appears.

18
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
In the <b>Name</b> field, enter <b>mygmailpage</b>.

19
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
Click on the <b>Folder</b> drop-down and select <b>Choose</b>.

20
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
Select <b>Bookmarks menu</b> and click on <b>New</b> folder.

21
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
A <b>New Folder</b> is created.

22
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Rename this folder <b>MyBookmarks</b>.

23
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
In <b>Tags</b>, type: <b>email</b>.

24
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
<b>Tag</b>s help us categorize bookmarks.

25
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
You can associate a number of tags with a bookmark.

26
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
For example, when you bookmark a shopping site,

27
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
You might tag it with the words gifts, books or toys.

28
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
Click <b>Done</b>.

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
Alternately, you can also press the <b>Ctrl </b>and <b>D </b>keys

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
to bookmark the page.

31
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
From the <b>Menu </b>bar, click on <b>Bookmarks</b>.

32
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
The <b>MyBookMarks </b>folder is displayed in the <b>Bookmarks </b>menu.

33
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Place the cursor on the folder.

34
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
The  <b>mygmailpage </b>bookmark is saved there.

35
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
Now, in the  <b>Address </b>bar, type the tag "email".

36
00:02:31 --> 00:02:37
Notice that the site <b>mygmailpage </b>is displayed as the first option on the list.

37
00:02:38 --> 00:02:44
So, we have renamed the bookmark, saved it in another folder and located it using a tag!

38
00:02:45 --> 00:02:52
Now, let’s bookmark the <b>www dot google dot com</b> website. <Pause>

39
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
In the Address bar, select the address and delete it.

40
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
Now type<b> www </b>dot <b>google</b> dot <b>com</b>

41
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Press <b>Enter</b>.

42
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
Now, from the right corner of the <b>Address bar</b>, click on the <b>star</b>.

43
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
The 'google' website is bookmarked.

44
00:03:12 --> 00:03:35
In the same manner, let’s bookmark four more sites <b>Spoken Tutorial</b>, <b>Yahoo</b>, <b>Firefox Add-ons</b> and <b>Ubuntu </b>.

45
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
Notice that we have not saved these bookmarks to a folder.

46
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
And how do we <b>delete a bookmark</b> we created?

47
00:03:44 --> 00:03:49
Of course, you’ve already noticed the <b>Remove bookmark </b>button in the <b>Edit This Bookmark </b>dialog box.

48
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
Let’s delete the <b>www.google.com</b> bookmark.

49
00:03:55 --> 00:04:02
In the <b>Address </b>bar, type: 'www.google.com'. Click on the yellow star.

50
00:04:03 --> 00:04:08
From the <b>Edit This Bookmark</b> dialog  box, click the <b>Remove Bookmark </b>button.

51
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
From <b>Menu </b>bar, click on <b>Bookmarks and MyBookmarks</b>.

52
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
The <b>google </b>bookmark is no longer visible in the <b>Bookmark </b>menu.

53
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
How can you access the bookmarks you created?

54
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
You can access bookmarks in many ways.

55
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
The easiest way to access a site that you bookmarked is to type the name in the <b>Address bar</b>.

56
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
Click on the <b>Address bar</b>, select the address displayed and delete it.

57
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
Now, in the<b> Address bar</b>, type the letter <b>G</b>.

58
00:04:43 --> 00:04:48
Notice that a list of the websites that begin with 'G' are displayed.

59
00:04:49 --> 00:04:54
These are also the sites that you've bookmarked, tagged, and visited.

60
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59

61

00:05:16 --> 00:05:23
Notice that the <b>Yahoo</b>, <b>Spoken Tutorial</b>, <b>Ubuntu </b>and <b>FireFox Add-ons </b>bookmarks are listed here.

65
