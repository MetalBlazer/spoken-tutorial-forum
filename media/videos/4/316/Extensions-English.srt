In this tutorial, we will learn about: <b>Extensions</b> or <b>Add-ons</b>, installing Extensions, recommended Extensions.

Here we are using <b>Firefox 7.0</b> on <b>Ubuntu 10.04</b>.

4
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
Let us open the <b>Firefox browser</b>.

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
By default, the <b>yahoo home page</b> opens.

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
What are <b>Extensions </b>or<b> Add-ons</b>?

00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
<b>Extensions </b>allow you to:

8
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
Add new features to the Firefox browser.

9
00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
Enhance existing features.

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
Customize the Firefox browser to suit your preferences.

11
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
<b>Extensions</b> are a part of the Firefox browser

12
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
and extend the browser’s capabilities.

13
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
For example, you can install <b>extensions</b> that:

14
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
Block advertisements or pop-ups.

15
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
Compare prices of commodities and even

17
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
Let’s install the <b>Grab and Drag</b> extension.

18
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
<b>Grab and Drag</b> let’s you scroll through web pages in various ways.

19
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
It is similar to the 'grab and drag' function in <b>Adobe Acrobat</b>.

20
00:01:12 --> 00:01:15
From the <b>Menu bar</b>, click <b>Tools </b>and <b>Add-ons</b>.

00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
