00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the<b> Spoken Tutorial</b> on<b> Overview of RDBMS - PostgreSQL</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:19
In this tutorial, we will learn about:
<p><b>RDBMS</b>, 
</p><p>features of <b>PostgreSQL</b> and the content available in various tutorials under this series. 
</p>

3
00:00:20 --> 00:00:33
For this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux </b>14.04 operating system, 
</p><p><b>PostgreSQL 9.3.x</b>, 
</p><p><b>pgAdmin 1.18</b>
</p>

4
00:00:34 --> 00:00:43
To follow this tutorial, you should have  good understanding of basic computer concepts and
<p>working knowledge of any programming language. 
</p>

5
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
First, let us learn about <b>RDBMS.</b>

6
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
<b>RDBMS</b> stands for <b>Relational Database Management System</b>.

7
00:00:53 --> 00:00:59
<b>RDBMS </b>is a program that helps to create, <b>update</b> and manage database.

8
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
<b>MS SQL Server</b>,
<p><b>IBM DB2</b>, 
</p><p><b>ORACLE</b>, 
</p>

9
00:01:06 --> 00:01:13
<b>My-SQL </b>and
<p><b>Microsoft Access</b>
</p><p>are some of the software based on <b>RDBMS</b>. 
</p>

10
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Next, let us see some of the key features of the<b> PostgreSQL.</b>

11
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
<b>PostgreSQL</b> is the most advanced <b>open source</b> <b>database management system.</b>

12
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
It can <b>run</b> on various platforms such as <b>Linux, Windows </b>and <b>Mac Operating System.</b>

13
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
It requires minimum maintenance because of its stability.

14
00:01:37 --> 00:01:44
We can define our own <b>data type</b>s, <b>index</b> types and develop a <b>custom plugin</b> to meet our requirement.

15
00:01:45 --> 00:01:52
An active community support is available to help solve issues when working with <b>PostgreSQL</b>.

16
00:01:53 --> 00:02:08
<b>PostgreSQL</b> can be used by  programmers, project managers, system administrators and
<p>any software professional, who want to build products, websites, tools, etc. 
</p>

17
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
Now, we will briefly go through the individual tutorials in this series.

18
00:02:15 --> 00:02:23
