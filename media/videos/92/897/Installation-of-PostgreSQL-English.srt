00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the<b> Spoken Tutorial</b> on<b> Installation of PostgreSQL.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:16
In this tutorial, we will learn to install <b>PostgreSQL </b>on  <b>Ubuntu Linux OS </b>and  <b>Windows </b>operating system.

3
00:00:17 --> 00:00:24
We will also learn to connect to <b>PostgreSQL</b> database and set password for the database.

4
00:00:25 --> 00:00:37
To record this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 14.04</b> operating system, 
</p><p><b>Windows 7 </b>operating system and
</p><p>a working internet connection. 
</p>

5
00:00:38 --> 00:00:48
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with either of the mentioned operating system
<p>and have working knowledge of any programming language. 
</p>

6
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
<b>PostgreSQL</b> is a <b>relational database management software</b>.

7
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
It is a powerful and most advanced <b>open source</b> database system.

8
00:00:59 --> 00:01:06
It <b>run</b>s on various platforms such as <b>Linux</b>, <b>Windows </b>and<b> Mac Operating System</b>.

9
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
First we will see how to install <b>PostgreSQL</b> on <b>Linux</b>.

10
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
Press <b>CTRL + ALT +T </b>keys simultaneously to open the <b>terminal</b>.

11
00:01:20 --> 00:01:33
In the <b>terminal</b> window, type: <b>sudo apt hyphen get update </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>
<p>Enter the <b>administrative password</b> if prompted. 
</p>

12
00:01:34 --> 00:01:42
This <b>command</b> will update the <b>Ubuntu's</b> default <b>repositori</b>es.
<p>Wait until it finishes all the <b>update</b>s. 
</p>

13
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
Press <b>Ctrl L</b> to clear the <b>screen</b>.

14
00:01:47 --> 00:01:58
Next, type: <b>sudo apt hyphen get install postgresql</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

15
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
We can see the installation process has begun.

16
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
Press '<b>Y'</b> wherever there is a prompt to confirm the configuration.

17
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
Installation will take sometime to complete, depending upon your internet speed.

18
00:02:15 --> 00:02:24
Now we can see that the installation has been completed successfully.
<p>Press <b>Ctrl + L</b> to clear the screen. 
</p>

19
00:02:25 --> 00:02:36
By default, a user account called <b>postgres</b> is created during installation.
<p>But there is no <b>password</b> set for this <b>user account</b>. 
</p>

20
00:02:37 --> 00:02:48
To set the <b>password</b>, type: <b>sudo hyphen u postgres psql postgres </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>

21
00:02:49 --> 00:02:58
Enter your <b>system password</b> if prompted.
<p>Notice that the <b>prompt</b> has changed to <b>postgres equal to hash.</b>
</p>

22
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
At the <b>prompt</b>, type: <b>slash password postgres.</b>

23
00:03:05 --> 00:03:14
Immediately you will be prompted to set a new <b>password</b> for the <b>Postgres user</b>.
<p>I'll enter the password as '<b>postgres'</b>. 
</p>

24
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
You can enter a password of your choice.

25
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
Enter the same password one more time.

26
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Please remember this password for future use.

27
00:03:27 --> 00:03:35
Next, type: <b>select version open bracket close bracket semicolon </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>

28
00:03:36 --> 00:03:40
Do not forget to put the semicolon at the end of each <b>statement</b>.

29
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
The <b>PostgreSQL</b> version that we have installed now, is displayed on the <b>terminal</b>.

30
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
This indicates that we have successfully installed <b>PostgreSQL.</b>

31
00:03:52 --> 00:03:59
I have increased the <b>terminal font size</b> for this demo.
<p>Hence the <b>output</b> is seen in a different window. 
</p>

32
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
So, I’ll hit the ‘<b>q</b>’ key to exit.
<p>You may not require to do so. 
</p>

33
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
Now let us see how to disconnect from the <b>server</b>.

34
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
Type <b>slash q </b>and press <b>Enter </b>to disconnect from the <b>server</b>.

35
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
Notice that we are back at the <b>command prompt</b> of the <b>terminal</b>.

36
00:04:23 --> 00:04:28
Every time when you want to work with <b>PostgreSQL</b>, you need to be connected to the <b>server</b>.

37
00:04:29 --> 00:04:34
<b>Psql</b> is an interactive <b>terminal</b> program provided by <b>PostgreSQL</b>.

38
00:04:35 --> 00:04:43
Using <b>psql</b> tool, we can execute <b>SQL</b> statements, manage <b>database objects </b>etc.

39
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
Another way to connect to a database is using <b>pgAdmin</b> <b>GUI application</b>.

40
00:04:51 --> 00:04:56
We can interact with <b>PostgreSQL database server </b>through this <b>interface</b>.

41
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
We will be demonstrating all features using <b>pgAdmin </b>in this series.

42
00:05:03 --> 00:05:10
Switch back to <b>terminal</b>.
<p>Let us again connect to the <b>postgreSQL database </b>from the <b>command line</b>. 
</p>

43
00:05:11 --> 00:05:28
For this, type: <b>sudo</b> <b>psql hyphen capital U postgres hyphen h localhost hyphen capital W </b>
<p>and press <b>Enter</b> to connect to the <b>server</b>. 
</p>

44
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
<b>hyphen h</b> is the <b>hostname</b> or <b>IP</b> of the <b>local server</b>.

45
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
Enter the password for <b>postgres user </b>which you have set after installation.

46
00:05:41 --> 00:05:48
We can see the prompt changes to <b>Postgres.</b>
<p>Press <b>Ctrl + L</b> to clear the screen. 
</p>

47
00:05:49 --> 00:05:56
Let us verify the <b>PostgreSQL</b> database and whether the <b>server</b> has been started by a simple query.

48
00:05:57 --> 00:06:04
Type: <b>Select current underscore user, now();</b>

49
00:06:05 --> 00:06:12
We can see the <b>user name</b> and current date as <b>output</b>.
<p>Hit ‘q’ key to exit. 
</p>

50
00:06:13 --> 00:06:20
During installation, some sample databases are created automatically.
<p>Let us have a look at them. 
</p>

51
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
Type: <b>slash list </b>or<b> slash l</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

52
00:06:28 --> 00:06:37
We can see the below database names that are available in <b>PostgreSQL server, </b>by default.
<p>Hit ‘q’ key to exit. 
</p>

53
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
To change a database', type: <b>slash c</b> database name.

54
00:06:45 --> 00:06:53
I will type: <b> slash c postgres</b>.
<p>Then type the <b>postgres</b> password. 
</p>

55
00:06:54 --> 00:07:01
We can see a message saying <b>You are now connected to database “postgres” as user “postgres”</b>.

56
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
We can create our own database and <b>tables</b> as per our requirement.

57
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
All the <b>database commands</b> can be executed from the <b>command line</b>.

58
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
Type: '<b>slash q'</b> to disconnect from the <b>server</b>.

59
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
Now let us see how to install <b>PgAdmin.</b>

60
00:07:21 --> 00:07:29
<b>PgAdmin</b> can be installed by using any one of the following methods on <b>Ubuntu Linux Operating System.</b>

61
00:07:30 --> 00:07:38
Go to <b>Ubuntu Software Centre </b>or<b> Synaptic Package manager, </b>search for<b> PgAdmin </b>and install.

62
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44

63
00:07:45 --> 00:07:55
Or, in the <b>Terminal</b>, type:  <b>sudo apt hyphen get install pgadmin3</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

64
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
I have already installed <b>PgAdmin</b> in my machine.
<p>I'll show how to open <b>PgAdmin.</b>
</p>

65
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
Click <b>Dash Home </b>on the top left corner of the desktop.

66
