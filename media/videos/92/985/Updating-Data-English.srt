<b>Narration</b>

00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the<b> Spoken Tutorial</b> on<b> Updating Data</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
In this tutorial, we will learn about <b>Update</b> statement and <b>Delete</b> statement.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:19
To record this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 14.04</b> operating system, 
</p>

4
00:00:20 --> 00:00:27
<b>PostgreSQL 9.3.x</b>
<p>and  <b>pgAdmin 1.18</b>
</p>

5
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
To follow this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of <b>SELECT</b> statement.

6
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
For more details, refer to the <b>RDBMS PostgreSQL</b> series on this website.

7
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
The <b>update</b> query is used to modify the existing records in a <b>table</b>.

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
We have to use the <b>WHERE clause</b> with the <b>UPDATE</b> statement to update the selected rows.

9
00:00:53 --> 00:01:02
The syntax for <b>update</b> statement is shown here.
<p>The <b>columns</b> to be modified are to be specified in the <b>SET</b> clause. 
</p>

10
00:01:03 --> 00:01:11
<b>Column1</b> would be assigned the <b>value1</b> and <b>Column2</b> would be assigned the <b>value2</b> and so on.

11
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
Other <b>column</b>s in the <b>table</b> will retain their previous values.

12
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
<b>WHERE</b> clause is used to find the exact row based on the specified <b>condition</b> to <b>update</b> it.

13
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
If no conditions are provided then all <b>record</b>s in the <b>table</b> will be updated.

14
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
Let's switch to <b>pgAdmin</b> main screen.

15
00:01:34 --> 00:01:42
Now, right-click on <b>students</b> node, then on <b>View data</b> and then on <b>View All rows.</b>

16
00:01:43 --> 00:01:50
Notice here - it says the student whose <b>id</b> is 's008', is from '<b>Chennai'</b> city.

17
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
Now I want to change the city to '<b>Bangalore'</b> for this student.

18
00:01:56 --> 00:02:04
Now, switch to the <b>SQL editor</b> window and type the <b>update</b> statement as shown here.

19
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
This is a simple <b>update statement </b>which updates a single <b>column</b>.

20
00:02:10 --> 00:02:17
The existing <b>city </b>value 'Chennai' will be changed to 'Bangalore' for the <b>studentid s008</b>.

21
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
<b>Execute</b> the <b>query</b>.
<p>We can see a message that the query is successful. 
</p>

22
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Let's retrieve the <b>record</b> to see the changes.

23
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
Clear the editor window and type this <b>select</b> statement.

24
00:02:34 --> 00:02:44
Now, execute the query to see the output.
<p>Note the updated value in the <b>city</b> field for student <b>‘s008’.</b>
</p>

25
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
Next we will see how to update multiple columns.

26
00:02:50 --> 00:03:01
Type the code. We can also update multiple columns by separating the <b>column </b>and value pairs, with commas, as shown here.

27
00:03:02 --> 00:03:07
Remember, the <b>date of birth</b> column was <b>null</b> for the student 'Ram charan'.

28
00:03:08 --> 00:03:15
This will update two columns, <b>date of birth </b>and <b>city,</b> with the values given in the <b>update statement.</b>

29
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
What will happen if you forget to give the <b>where</b> condition?

30
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
The entire <b>students table </b>will be updated with the given value.

31
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Execute the query.

32
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
Let us see the updated value for the student name ‘Ram Charan’.

33
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Type the <b>select</b> statement as shown here.

34
00:03:37 --> 00:03:45
Execute the query.
<p>We can see the <b>date of birth</b> column and <b>city</b> column have been updated. 
</p>

35
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Next we will learn about the<b> delete</b> statement.

36
00:03:50 --> 00:03:58
The syntax for <b>delete</b> statement is as follows:
<p><b>DELETE FROM table-name </b>
</p><p><b>[WHERE condition]</b>
</p>

37
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
<b>WHERE</b> clause is used in the <b>delete</b> statement to delete specific rows which satisfy a particular <b>condition</b>.

38
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
All records will be deleted if no <b>conditions </b>are specified.

39
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Let us see an example of the <b>delete statement</b>.

40
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Switch to the <b>SQL Editor</b> window.

41
00:04:18 --> 00:04:27
Type the code as shown here.
<p>This statement will delete the student record whose <b>id </b>is '<b>s014'</b>. 
</p>

42
00:04:28 --> 00:04:33
Let us execute the query.
<p>So, one row is deleted now. 
</p>

43
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
If you want to remove all the rows from the <b>students</b> table, type <b>delete from students</b>.

44
00:04:40 --> 00:04:49
There is no <b>Where</b> condition is specified here.
<p>I'll not execute the query, as I don’t want to delete all the records. 
</p>

45
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
Next let us see an example where we have two <b>conditions</b> in the <b>DELETE statement</b>.

46
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
Type the code as shown here.

47
00:05:01 --> 00:05:14
This <b>delete statement </b>will delete the student details which satisfies two different <b>conditions.</b>
<p>That is, the <b>department</b> should be '<b>CS'</b> and  <b>CGPA</b> score should be less than 7.5 
</p>

48
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Let us execute this query.

49
00:05:18 --> 00:05:26
In the output, we can see <b>‘0 rows affected’</b>.
<p>This indicates that no records are deleted. 
</p>

50
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
That means there are no records in the <b>student table</b> which satisfies both the <b>conditions</b>.

51
00:05:34 --> 00:05:46
With this we have covered the basics of common <b>SQL statements</b> such as
<p><b>INSERT</b> ,  <b>SELECT</b> ,  <b>DELETE </b>  and <b>UPDATE </b>  in this series. 
</p>

52
00:05:47 --> 00:05:57
These statements are otherwise called as <b>Data Manipulation language.</b>
<p><b>DML</b> is the short form of <b>Data Manipulation Language.</b>
</p>

53
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
It includes <b>commands</b> that are used to manipulate data in a <b>database</b>.

54
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
With this we come to the end of this tutorial.
<p>Let us summarize. 
</p>

55
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
In this tutorial, we have learnt about the -  <b>Update</b> statement and  <b>Delete</b> statement.

56
00:06:17 --> 00:06:27
As an assignment, for <b>studentid 's013'</b>, modify the student name from '<b>Sharmila'</b> to '<b>Sharmila Babu'</b> in the <b>students</b> table.

57
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
Delete the students whose <b>cgpa</b> is less than 5.

00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
