Welcome to the<b> Spoken Tutorial</b> on<b> Create a database using pgAdmin.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
In this tutorial, we will learn about how to:
<p>connect to the <b>server</b>, 
</p>

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
database and its <b>object</b>s,
<p>how to create a database, 
</p>

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
<b>Table</b> and its <b>attributes</b> and
<p>how to create a <b>table</b>. 
</p>

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
To record this  tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 14.04</b> operating system, 
</p>

6
00:00:30 --> 00:00:37
<b>PostgreSQL 9.3.x</b> and
<p><b>pgAdmin 1.18</b>
</p>

7
00:00:38 --> 00:00:47
To follow this tutorial, you should have good understanding of basic computer concepts and
<p>working knowledge of any programming language. 
</p>

8
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
Let us open the <b>pgAdmin</b>.

9
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
Click<b> Dash Home</b> on the top left corner of the computer desktop.

10
00:00:56 --> 00:01:04
In the <b>Search box</b>, type:<b> pgAdmin</b>. The <b>pgAdmin</b> icon appears. Click on it.

11
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
The <b>pgAdmin</b> interface is opened now.

12
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
Here, on the left hand side, we can see the <b>object browser pane</b>.

13
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
The various objects of the database are displayed here.

14
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
The upper right pane shows the relevant properties of each object.

15
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
The lower right pane is the <b>SQL</b> pane where the script of the currently selected object is displayed.

16
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
Let us see how to connect to the <b>server</b>.

17
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
Click on the <b>connection icon</b> on the top left corner of the tool bar.

18
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
<b>New Server Registration</b> window appears.

19
00:01:43 --> 00:01:55
In the <b>Properties </b>tab, enter <b>localhost</b> in the <b>Name</b> field and <b>localhost</b> in the <b>Host </b>field.
<p>Keep all the other <b>parameter</b>s same. 
</p>

20
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
The <b>database</b> name, and the <b>Username</b> which are shown here are the names given during installation.

21
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
Enter the password which you gave during installation.
<p>Click on <b>Ok</b> button. 
</p>

22
00:02:10 --> 00:02:17
Small pop-up windows will appear from time to time.
<p>These give additional information for our understanding. 
</p>

23
00:02:18 --> 00:02:26
Always click on this check-box '<b>Do not show this hint again'</b>, before you close these windows.
<p>I won't explicitly mention this. 
</p>

24
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Click on <b>Ok</b> button.

25
00:02:30 --> 00:02:37
Here, we can see the connection established to <b>localhost</b>.
<p>Click on the <b>localhost</b> node. 
</p>

26
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
We can see several objects for this particular <b>server</b>.

27
00:02:42 --> 00:02:51
Now, click on the <b>Databases</b> node.
<p>The default <b>database 'postgres'</b> that is created during installation is displayed here. 
</p>

28
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
<b>Database</b> is a collection of information or data which is stored in an organized way.

29
00:02:59 --> 00:03:06
A <b>database</b> has objects such as <b>tables, views, procedures, functions</b> etc.

30
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
We will learn about these objects in the future tutorials, in this series.

31
00:03:12 --> 00:03:17
We can have multiple databases depending upon our application requirement.

32
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
Switch back to <b>pgAdmin</b> interface.

33
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
Now, we will create a new database for our demonstration purpose.

34
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
Right-click on the <b>Databases</b> node and select <b>New Database.</b>

35
00:03:31 --> 00:03:36
Type <b>Sampledb</b> as the <b>database</b> name and click <b>Ok</b>.

36
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
Now, we can see the <b>database</b> is listed under the <b>database</b> node, which we created just now.

37
00:03:44 --> 00:03:49
Next, we will add a <b>student</b> table to this <b>sampledb database</b>.

38
00:03:50 --> 00:03:57
What is <b>table</b>? In <b>RDBMS,</b> we store data in database objects called <b>tables</b>.

39
00:03:58 --> 00:04:03
A <b>table</b> is a collection of related data that is stored in <b>rows</b> and <b>columns </b>format.

40
00:04:04 --> 00:04:10
This is an example of a <b>STUDENT</b> table.
<p><b>Tables</b> have <b>column</b>s which are called as <b>fields</b>. 
</p>

41
00:04:11 --> 00:04:21
The fields in the <b>STUDENT</b> table are <b>Student ID, student name, address, city, Phone, Date of birth, CGPA </b>etc.

42
00:04:22 --> 00:04:29
A column is a set of value of a particular <b>data type</b>. This is also called as <b>attribute</b>.

43
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
Here, in the <b>STUDENT</b> table, <b>Student Name</b> is one of the <b>attribute</b> that represents names of students.

44
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
Now switch back to the <b>interface</b>.

45
00:04:41 --> 00:04:52
To create a new <b>table</b> in <b>Sampledb</b> database, click on the <b>Sampledb</b> node.
<p>Then click <b>Schemas</b> and then <b>Public</b> and <b>Tables</b>. 
</p>

46
00:04:53 --> 00:05:01
Right-click on the <b>table</b> node and select <b>New Table.</b>
<p>Let us give “<b>students</b>” as <b>table</b> name. 
</p>

47
00:05:02 --> 00:05:09
Click on the <b>Columns</b> tab to enter the columns for this <b>table</b>.
<p>Click on the <b>Add</b> button. 
</p>

48
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
In the new window that opens, enter <b>Student name</b> in the <b>Name</b> field.

49
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
Select <b>character varying</b> as <b>data type</b> from the drop-down list box.

50
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
The <b>data type</b> specifies what <b>type</b> of data the field can hold.

51
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
Enter 50 as the length of the <b>field</b>.

52
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
The length specifies the maximum length of the <b>column</b> of the <b>table</b>.

53
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
Click <b>Ok</b> button to add column to the <b>table</b>.

54
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
We will see what are the common <b>data types</b> used in <b>PostgreSQL</b>.

55
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
<b>Integer, numeric</b> represents <b>numeric data type</b>.

56
00:05:48 --> 00:05:54
For example: phone no, age, quantity are of <b>numeric data type</b>.

57
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
<b>numeric(n,d) - </b>is also <b>numeric data type</b> with decimal places.

58
00:06:01 --> 00:06:06
Here <b>n</b> is the total digits and <b>d</b> is the number of digits after the decimal.

59
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
It can be used to represent fields like basic salary, unit price etc.

60
00:06:14 --> 00:06:18
<b>char</b> and <b>character varying</b> represents <b>string data type</b>.

61
00:06:19 --> 00:06:28
Fields such as <b>name, address, email</b> are of <b>string data type</b>.
<p><b>Text</b> is a <b>string data type</b> with unlimited length. 
</p>

62
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
<b>Date</b> represents <b>date</b> data type.

63
00:06:33 --> 00:06:40
Likewise, I'll add <b>City</b> column with <b>character varying data type</b> and length as 40.

64
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Add the column <b>Gender</b> as shown.

65
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Add a <b>Date of Birth</b> column with <b>date</b> data type.

66
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
Next, add a <b>CGPA</b> field. Select the <b>data type</b> as <b>numeric</b>.

67
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
Enter <b>2</b> as length and <b>1</b> as precision. This is same as the <b>decimal</b> data type.

68
00:07:03 --> 00:07:10
We have entered all the columns for the <b>student</b> table.  Click on <b>Ok</b> button.

69
00:07:11 --> 00:07:20
A window shows some message about <b>Primary keys</b>.
<p>We will see the importance of <b>Primary keys</b> in the future tutorials. 
</p>

70
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
We can see the <b>student</b> table is created in the <b>sampledb</b> database.
<p>Click on it. 
</p>

71
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
In the <b>SQL pane</b>, we can see the syntax of the <b>create table</b> command generated automatically.

72
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

73
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
In this tutorial, we have learnt -  how to connect to the <b>server</b>,
<p><b>database</b> and its objects, 
</p>

74
00:07:47 --> 00:07:53
How to create a <b>database</b>,
<p><b>Table</b> and its <b>attributes</b> and  how to create a <b>table</b>. 
</p>

75
00:07:54 --> 00:07:59
As an Assignment, connect to the <b>server</b> and check the default available database.

76
00:08:00 --> 00:08:12
Create a new database <b>Organization</b>.  In the <b>Organization</b> database, create a table <b>Emp</b> with the columns <b>Emp name, Address, Date of Birth</b> and <b>Salary</b>.
