<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Nested if</b> and <b>Switch statements in C and C++</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial we will learn,

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
how to use <b>nested if</b> statement and

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
<b>switch</b> statement.We will do this with the help of some examples.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
To record this tutorial, I am using

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
<b>Ubuntu operating system version 11.10</b>,

7
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
<b>gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu</b>.

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
First we will learn how to write <b>nested if</b> and <b>switch</b> statements with an example.

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
I have already written the program.

10
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
Let’s have a look. In this program we will learn to check the range of integers.

11
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
Note that our file name is <b>nested-if.c</b>.

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
Let me explain the code now.

13
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
This is our Header file.

14
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
This is our  main() function.

15
00:00:56 --> 00:01:01
Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables '<b>x and y'</b>.

16
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
Here we prompt the users to enter a number between the range of<b> 0 to 39</b>.

17
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
We take the value of <b>y</b> as input from the user.

18
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
This is our <b>if</b> condition.

19
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Here, we will check whether y/10=0.

20
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
If the condition is true, we print <b>"you have entered the number in the range of 0-9".</b>

21
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
This is our <b>else-if</b> condition.

22
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
Here we check that y/10 equals to 1.

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
If the condition is true,

24
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
we print <b> "you have entered a number in the range of 10-19".</b>

25
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
In this <b>else if</b> condition we check whether the number is in the range of 20-29.

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
And here we will see that the number is in the range of 30 to 39.

27
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
This is our <b>else</b> condition.

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
If all of the above conditions are false,

29
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
we print<b> "number not in range".</b>

30
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
And this is our <b>return</b> statement.

31
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Now let us execute the program.

32
00:02:03 --> 00:02:11
Please open the terminal window by pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt</b> and <b>T</b> keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

33
00:02:12 --> 00:02:22
To execute, type <b>gcc space nested-if.c space hyphen o space nested</b>. Press <b>Enter</b>.

34
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
Type dot slash “nested” (./nested). Press <b>Enter</b>.

35
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
We see <b>Enter a number between 0 to 39</b>.

36
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
I will enter <b>12</b>.

37
00:02:34 --> 00:02:34
The output is displayed as:

38
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
<b> you have entered the  number  in the range of 10-19</b>.

39
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Let us enter another number.

40
00:02:42 --> 00:02:47
Let's execute again. Press the up arrow key, press <b>Enter</b>.

41
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
I will give <b> 5</b> this time.

42
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
We see the output as :

43
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
<b>you have entered the number in the range of 0-9</b>.

44
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
The conditional execution can also be done in another way.

45
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
By using <b>switch</b> statement.

46
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Let’s see how it is done.

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
We will see  the same program using <b>switch</b>.

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
I have already opened the program.

49
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Let's switch back to our text editor.

50
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
I have explained this in the previous program.

51
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
So I will move on to the <b>switch</b> statements.

52
00:03:20 --> 00:03:27
Here, we divide the inputs i.e <b>y</b>  by 10 and the result  is  stored in  the variable <b>x</b>.

53
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
That means the quotient will be stored in x.

54
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
With the help of the quotient we can identify the range of the number.

55
00:03:36 --> 00:03:40
Here, we tell the switch command that the variable to be checked is <b>x</b>.

56
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
This is <b>case 0</b> . If case 0 is satisfied

57
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
then we print <b>you have entered  the number in the range of 0-9.</b>

58
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
We add <b>break </b>to come out of the loop if the case is satisfied.

59
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
We need to <b>break </b>the loop each time.

60
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
It is because only one condition can be true at a time.

61
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
This is “case 1”. “case 1” means “if the value of <b>x </b>is 1”.

62
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
We print <b>you have entered a number in the range of 10-19.</b>

63
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
This is   “case 2” .

64
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
Here  we print <b>you have entered a number in the range of 20-29.</b>

65
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
And this is case 3. Here we check whether the number is in the range of 30-39.

66
00:04:26 --> 00:04:35
This is the default case. Default case specifies what needs to be done if none of the above cases are satisfied.

67
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
Here we print "number not in range".

68
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
And This is our <b>return</b> statement.

69
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
Let us execute the program.

70
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Switch back to the terminal.

71
00:04:46 --> 00:04:54
Type <b>gcc space switch.c space -o space switch</b>. Press Enter.

72
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
Type <b>./switch</b>(dot slash switch). Press Enter.

73
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
Enter a number between 0 to  39. I will enter 35.

74
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
The output is displayed as “you have entered the number in the range of 30 to 39”.

75
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
Now we will see how to execute the programs  in C++.

76
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Switch back to the text editor.

77
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
Note that our file name is <b>nested-if.cpp</b>.

78
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Here the logic and implementation are same.

79
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
There are a few changes like:

80
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
The header file as "iostream" in place of "stdio.h".

81
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Here we have included the <b>using</b> statement

82
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
<b>Using namespace std</b>.

83
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
And the  <b>cout</b> and <b>cin</b> function in place of <b>printf</b> and <b>scanf</b>.

84
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
You can see that the rest of the code is similar to our C program.

85
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Let’s execute the code.

86
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Come back to the terminal.

87
00:05:56 --> 00:06:06
Type <b>g++ space nested-if.cpp space -o space nested1</b>. Press Enter.

88
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Type <b>./nested1</b>. Press Enter.

89
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
Enter a number between 0 to 39. I will enter 40.

90
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
The output is displayed as: “number not in range”

91
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
Now let’s see the switch program in C++.

92
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
Come back to our text editor.

93
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
Here also the logic and implementation are same.

94
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
You can see that the  header file is <b>iostream</b>.

95
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
Here is the <b>using</b> statement.

96
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
And we have changed the <b>cout</b> and <b>cin</b> function.

97
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Rest of the code is similar to our switch.c program.

98
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
Let us execute.Come back to our terminal.

99
00:06:48 --> 00:06:57
Type <b>g++ space switch.cpp space -o space switch1</b>. Press Enter.

100
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
Type <b>./switch1</b>. Press Enter.

101
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Enter a number between 0 to 39.

102
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
I will enter 25.

103
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
The output is displayed as:

104
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
“you have entered  the number in the range of 20-29”

105
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Now let us switch back to our slides.

106
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
We will see the comparison between switch and nested-if statements.

107
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
Switch statement is evaluated according to the result of the expression.

108
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
Netsed-if statement is run only if the result of the expression is true.

109
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
In <b>switch</b>, we treat various values of the variable as <b>cases</b>.

110
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
In nested-if we have to write the conditional statement for each value of the variable.

111
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
Switch statement can only check the integer values.

112
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
Nested if can check for both, integer and fractional values.

113
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

114
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Let us summarize.

115
00:08:00 --> 00:08:07
In this tutorial, we learnt * 'nested if' statement. e.g. else if( y/10 equals to 0)

116
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
switch statement. e.g. switch(x) and

117
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Difference between nested-if and switch statements.

118
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
