<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on <b>Arrays</b> in <b>C</b> and <b>C++.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial we will learn:

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
What is an <b>array</b>

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
Declaration of an <b>array </b>

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Initialization of an <b>array </b>

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Few Examples on array.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
To record this tutorial, I am using

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
<b>Ubuntu Operating System</b> version 11.04,

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
<b>gcc</b> and <b>g++ Compiler</b> version 4.6.1 .

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
Let us start with the introduction to <b>Array.</b>

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
<b>Array</b> is the collection of data or elements of same data-type.

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
<b>Array</b> index starts from 0.

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
The first element is stored at index 0.

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
There are three types of arrays:

16
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
<b>Single dimensional array </b>

17
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
<b>Two dimensional array</b> and

18
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
<b>Multi-dimensional array. </b>

19
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
We will be discussing single dimensional array in this tutorial.

20
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
Let us see how to declare <b>single dimensional array.</b>

21
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
The Syntax for this is:

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
<b>data-type name of the array</b> and <b>size</b>

23
00:01:16 --> 00:01:23
example, here we have declared an <b>integer array</b> 'star' which contains 5 elements.

24
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
The array index will start from star 0 to star 4.

25
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
We saw the declaration of an array.

26
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
Now, we will see the initialization of an array.

27
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
The Syntax for this is:

28
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
<b>data-type,( name of the array ), size is equal to elements</b>

29
00:01:44 --> 00:01:53
example: here we have declared an 'integer array star' with size 3. The elements of the array are 1,2 and 3.

30
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
Here the index will start from star 0 to star 2.

31
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
Now, lets us move to the examples.

32
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
I have already typed the program on the editor.

33
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
So, let me open it.

34
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
Please note that our file name is <b>array.c </b>

35
00:02:10 --> 00:02:15
In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements stored in an array.

36
00:02:16 --> 00:02:17
Let me explain the code now.

37
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
This is our <b>header file.</b>

38
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
This is our <b>main()</b> function.

39
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
Here, we have declared and initialized an array <b>star</b> with size 3.

40
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
The elements of the array are 4, 5 and 6.

41
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Then we have declared an 'integer variable' <b>sum</b>.

42
00:02:36 --> 00:02:40
Here we add the elements of the array and store the result in <b>sum</b>.

43
00:02:41 --> 00:02:49
Note that 4 will be stored at index 0, 5 will be stored at index 1 and 6 will be stored at index 2.

44
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
Then we print the sum.

45
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
This is our <b>return</b> statement.

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Now, click on <b>Save.</b>

47
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
Let us execute the program.

48
00:02:59 --> 00:03:08
Please open the terminal window by pressing <b>Ctrl, Alt</b> and <b>T </b> keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

49
00:03:09 --> 00:03:18
To compile, type <b>gcc space array dot c space hypen o array</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

50
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
To execute, type <b>dot slash array </b>(./array). Press <b>Enter</b>.

51
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
Here the output is displayed as,

52
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
<b>The sum is 15.</b>

53
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Now let us see some common errors which we can come across.

54
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
Come back to our program.

55
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
Suppose, here at line number 4, we miss the curly brackets.

56
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
Click on <b>Save</b>. Let us see what happens.

57
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
Come back to the terminal.

58
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Let us compile as before.

59
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
We see an error:

60
00:03:49 --> 00:03:55
Invalid initializer and Expected identifier or bracket before numeric constant.

61
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
This is because arrays must be initialized within curly brackets.

62
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Come back to our program. Let us fix the error.

63
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
Type the curly brackets here at line number 4.

64
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Now, click on <b>Save</b>.

65
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
Lets us execute. Come back to the terminal.

66
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.

67
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Yes, it is working.

68
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Now we will execute the same program in C++.

69
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Come back to our program.

70
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
I will change a few things here.

71
00:04:30 --> 00:04:37
First, press <b>Shift , Ctrl</b> and <b>S</b> keys  simultaneously on your keyboard.

72
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
Now save the file with the extension <b>dot cpp</b> (.cpp) and click on <b>Save</b>.

73
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
Let us change the <b> header file</b> as <b>iostream</b>.

74
00:04:49 --> 00:04:54
Now include the <b>using</b> statement.

75
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
The declaration and initialization of an array is same in C++.

76
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Hence no need to change anything here.

77
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
Now replace the <b>printf</b> statement with the <b>cout</b> statement.

78
00:05:09 --> 00:05:16
Delete the format specifier and backslash n (\n), now delete the comma and type two opening angle brackets.

79
00:05:17 --> 00:05:25
Delete the bracket here. Again type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type backslash n (\n).

80
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
Now, click on <b>Save.</b>

81
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.

82
00:05:32 --> 00:05:41
To compile, type <b>g++ space array dot cpp space hyphen o space array1</b>

83
00:05:42 --> 00:05:50
Here we have array1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter <b>array</b> for the file <b>array dot c</b>.

84
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
Now press <b>Enter.</b>

85
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
To execute type,<b> dot slash array1</b>(./array1) . Press <b>Enter</b>.

86
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
The output is displayed as: <b>The sum is 15</b>

87
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
We can see that it is similar to our C code.

88
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
Now, we will see another common error.

89
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
Come back to our program.

90
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Suppose here, at line number 7,

91
00:06:14 --> 00:06:22
I will type star[1],  star[2] and  star[3];

92
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
click on Save.Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.

93
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
Let me clear the prompt.

94
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Let us compile as before.

95
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Let us execute as before.

96
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
We get an unexpected output.

97
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
This is because array index starts from 0.

98
00:06:43 --> 00:06:48
Come back to our program. We can see here the array index starts from one.

99
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Hence it is giving an error. Let us fix the error.

100
00:06:54 --> 00:07:01
Type 0 here 1 and 2. Click on Save.

101
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.

102
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
Let us compile as before. Execute as before.

103
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
Yes, it is working.

104
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Now, we will go back to our slides.

105
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
Le us summarize.

106
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
In this tutorial we learned:

107
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
Arrays , To declare Single Dimensional Arrays

108
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
To initialize Single Dimensional Arrays

109
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
example <b>int star[3]={4, 5, 6}</b>

110
00:07:31 --> 00:07:39
To add the elements of the array, example sum is equal to star 0 plus star 1 plus star 2.

111
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
As an assignment, write a program to calculate the difference of the elements stored in an array.

112
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
