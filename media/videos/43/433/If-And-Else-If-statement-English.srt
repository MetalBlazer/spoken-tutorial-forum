00:00:02 --> 00:00:07
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Conditional statements in C and C++</b>.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
In this tutorial we will learn:

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
How to execute a single <b>statement</b>

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
How to execute group of <b>statements</b>.

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
We will do this through examples.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
To record this tutorial, I am using <b>Ubuntu Operating system</b> version 11.10.

8
00:00:31 --> 00:00:37
<b>gcc</b> and <b>g++ Compiler</b> version 4.6.1.

9
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
Let us start with the introduction to conditional <b>statements</b>.

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
A <b>statement</b> in a program controls the flow of program execution.

11
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
It helps to make decision on what code is to be executed.

12
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
We can check the conditions, whether true or false.

13
00:01:00 --> 00:01:06
We can execute a single statement or a group of statements.

14
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
Let us understand the flow of <b>if</b> statements.

15
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
Here, if the condition is true then <b>statement 1</b> will be executed.

16
00:01:20 --> 00:01:28
If the condition is false then <b>statement 2</b> will be executed.

17
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
Now we will see the flow of <b>else if</b> statement.

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:40
Here, if <b>condition 1</b> is true then <b>statement 1</b> will be executed.

19
00:01:41 --> 00:01:48
If <b>condition 1</b> is false then it will check for another condition that is <b>condition 2</b>.

20
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
If <b>condition 2</b> is true then <b>statement 3</b> will be executed.

21
00:01:54 --> 00:02:01
And If <b>condition 2</b> is false then <b>statement 2</b> will be executed.

22
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
Now Let us move on to our program.

23
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
I have already typed the code on the editor.

24
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
So, let me open it.

25
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
Note that our file name is <b>ifstmt.c</b>.

26
00:02:18 --> 00:02:25
In this program we will calculate the sum of two numbers and will check a few conditions.

27
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
Let me explain the code now.

28
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
This is our <b>header file.</b>

29
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
This is our <b>main()</b> function.

30
00:02:38 --> 00:02:45
Here we have declared three <b>integer variables</b> <b>a, b</b> and <b>sum.</b>

31
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Here we are asking for user input.

32
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
User will enter the values of a and b.

33
00:02:52 --> 00:02:57
The values will be stored in <b>variable a</b> and <b>variable b.</b>

34
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
The <b>scanf()</b> function reads data from the console.

35
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
It then stores the result in the given <b>variable.</b>

36
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
The <b>format specifier</b> in the <b>scanf()</b> helps to know the type of data.

37
00:03:10 --> 00:03:17
Like here we have <b>%d</b>, it denotes that we are dealing with integer data type.

38
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Here we add the values of <b>a</b> and <b>b.</b>

39
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
We will store the result in <b>sum.</b>

40
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Then we print the result.

41
00:03:29 --> 00:03:29
This is our <b>if</b> statement.

42
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
Here, we check the condition whether <b>sum</b> is greater than 20.

43
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
If the condition is true, then we print <b>Sum</b> is greater than 20.

44
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
Now let me comment out these lines.

45
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
This is our <b>return</b> statement.

46
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
Now click on <b>Save</b>.

47
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
First we will see the execution of <b>if</b> statement.

48
00:03:58 --> 00:04:08
Please open the terminal window by pressing <b>Ctrl, Alt</b> and <b>T</b> keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

49
00:04:09 --> 00:04:19
To compile, type <b>gcc space ifstmt dot c space  -o space if</b> and press Enter.

50
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
To execute,  type <b>./if</b> (dot slash if). Press Enter.

51
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
It is displayed as <b>Enter the values of a and b</b>.

52
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
I will give the values as 10 and 12.

53
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
The output is displayed as <b>Sum of a and b is 22. Sum is greater than 20</b>.

54
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
Now come back to our program.

55
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
We will check another condition.

56
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
Let me remove the comment from here.

57
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
I will give the comment here.

58
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
Now click on <b>Save.</b>  This is our <b>else-if</b> statement.

59
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
Here, we check another condition whether <b>Sum</b> is greater than 10.

60
00:05:11 --> 00:05:17
If the condition is true then we print 'Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20'.

61
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Now come back to our terminal.

62
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Let us compile as before.

63
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Let us execute as before.

64
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
It is displayed as

65
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
<b>Enter the value of a and b</b>.

66
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
I will give the values as 10 and 2.

67
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
The output is displayed as: <b>Sum of a and b is 12</b>.

68
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
<b>Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20</b>.

69
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
Let me clear the prompt.

70
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Now come back to our program.

71
00:05:48 --> 00:05:55
I will remove the comment from here and here. Now click on Save.

72
00:05:56 --> 00:06:03
If both the above conditions are false then we print 'Sum is less than 10'.

73
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
This is our <b>else</b> statement.

74
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Now let us execute and see.  Come back to our terminal.

75
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.

76
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
Here it is displayed as <b>Enter the value of a and b</b>.

77
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
I will give the values as 3 and 5.

78
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
The output is displayed as <b>sum of a and b is 8</b>.

79
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
<b>Sum is less than 10</b>.

80
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.

81
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
Come back to our program.

82
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46
Suppose, here at the end of <b>if</b> statement I will type a semicolon (;).

83
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Let us see what will happen. Click on <b>Save.</b>

84
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.

85
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Let us compile as before.

86
00:06:56 --> 00:07:01
We see an error: <b> 'else' without a previous 'if' </b>

87
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
Come back to our program. It is a syntax error.

88
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
<b>if</b> statement will never terminate with a semicolon.

89
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
And the <b>else if</b> statement will never work without an <b>if</b>.

90
00:07:16 --> 00:07:21
Let us fix the error. Delete the semicolon (;) here.

91
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
Now Click on <b>Save.</b>

92
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
Let us execute. Come back to the terminal.

93
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.

94
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
Enter the value of a and b.

95
00:07:37 --> 00:07:42
I will give the values as 3 and 6.

96
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
The output is displayed as

97
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
<b>Sum of a and b is 9. Sum is less than 10</b>.

98
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
NOW WE WILL SEE HOW TO EXECUTE THE SAME PROGRAM IN C++.

99
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
Come back to our program.

100
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
I will change a few things here.

101
00:08:03 --> 00:08:10
Press <b>Shift, Ctrl</b> and <b>S</b>  keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

102
00:08:11 --> 00:08:19
Now save the file with an extension <b>dot cpp</b> and click on <b> Save</b>.

103
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
We will change the header file as <b>iostream</b>.

104
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Let us include the <b>using </b>statement here.

105
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
Now click on the Search for and replace text option.

106
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
Let us replace the <b>printf </b>statement with the <b>cout</b> statement.

107
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
Click on <b>Replace all</b> and click on Close.

108
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Now delete the closing brackets here.

109
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
Replace the <b>scanf()</b> statement with the <b>cin</b> statement.

110
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
Type <b>cin</b> and <b>two closing angle brackets >></b>.

111
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
As we use <b>cin >></b> function to read a line in C++.

112
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
Now delete the <b>format specifiers</b>.

113
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
Delete the <b>comma</b> and <b>ampersand &</b>.

114
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
Delete the comma here and type two closing angle brackets.

115
00:09:17 --> 00:09:24
Again delete the <b>ampersand</b>and the closing brackets. Now click on <b>Save</b>.

116
00:09:25 --> 00:09:30
Here delete the closing bracket and the comma.

117
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
Now delete the <b>backslash n (\n)</b> and <b>format specifier</b>.

118
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
Now type two opening brackets.

119
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
Again type two opening angle brackets  and <b>within the double quotes type backslash n “\n”.</b>

120
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Here also we will delete the closing bracket.

121
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
Now again delete the closing bracket here and here.

122
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
Now click on <b>Save</b>.

123
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
Let us execute.

124
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
Come back to the terminal. Let me clear the prompt.

125
00:10:10 --> 00:10:19
To compile, type <b>g++ space ifstmt.cpp space -o space if1</b>

126
00:10:20 --> 00:10:30
Here we have 'if1' because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter <b>if </b>for the file 'ifstmt.c'.

127
00:10:31 --> 00:10:38
Now Press 'Enter'.To execute type <b>./if1</b> (dot slash if1) and press <b>Enter</b>.

128
00:10:39 --> 00:10:47
Enter the value of <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>. I will give the values as 20 and 10.

129
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
The output is displayed as <b>Sum of a and b is 30</b>

130
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
<b>Sum is greater than 20</b>

131
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

132
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
Now come back to our slides.

133
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
Let us summarize.

134
00:11:04 --> 00:11:10
In this tutorial we learned 'if' statement eg. if(condition),

135
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
And 'else if' statement eg. else if(condition).

136
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
As an assignment, Write a program to check 'a' is greater than 'b' or less than 'b'.

137
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
Hint: use 'if' statement.

138
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
Write another program to check which value is greater 'a', 'b' or 'c'.

139
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
Hint: use 'else-if' statement.

140
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
