<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:07
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Scope of variables in C and C++</b>.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
In this tutorial we will learn,

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
What is the Scope of variable?

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
What is a Global variable?

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
What is a Local variable?

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Few  examples.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.

8
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
To record this tutorial, I am using

9
00:00:30 --> 00:00:40
<b>Ubuntu Operating System</b> version 11.04, <b>gcc</b> and <b>g++ Compiler</b> version 4.6.1.

10
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
Let us start with the introduction to the scope of variables.

11
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
It is the region of code within which the variable can be accessed.

12
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
Depending on it's type and place of declaration it is divided into two categories:

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
Global Variable &

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
Local Variable.

15
00:01:05 --> 00:01:06
Now we will see an example.

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
I have already typed the program on the editor.

17
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
Let me open it.

18
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Note that our file name is <b>scope.c.</b>

19
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
Let me explain the code now.

20
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
This is our <b>header file.</b>

21
00:01:26 --> 00:01:31
Here we have declared two global variables <b>a and b.</b>

22
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
And we have <b>initialized</b> them by assigning values as <b>5 and 2.</b>

23
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
A global variable is available to all functions in your program.

24
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
These are declared outside any functions, above main() function.

25
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
These have a <b>global scope.</b>

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
Here we have declared a <b>function</b> <b>add </b>without<b> arguments.</b>

27
00:01:59 --> 00:02:06
Here 'sum' is  a local variable, it is declared inside the function <b>add</b>.

28
00:02:07 --> 00:02:12
A local variable is available only to the function inside which it is declared.

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
These variables are declared inside a block.

30
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
These have <b>local scope</b>.

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:28
Then sum of a & b will be stored in the variable 'sum'. Here we print the sum.

32
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
This is our <b>main()</b> function.

33
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
The <b>add</b> function is called and then executed.

34
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
And this is our <b>return</b> statement.

35
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Now click on Save.

36
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
Let us execute the program.

37
00:02:45 --> 00:02:54
Please open the terminal window  by pressing <b>Ctrl, Alt</b> and <b>T</b> keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

38
00:02:55 --> 00:03:04
To compile, type <b>gcc space scope.c space hyphen o space sco</b> and press Enter.

39
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
To execute, type <b>./sco</b> (dot slash sco), press Enter.

40
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
The output is displayed as

41
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
<b>Sum of a and b is 7</b>.

42
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.

43
00:03:20 --> 00:03:30
Come back to our program. First press <b>Shift, Ctrl</b> & <b>S</b> keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

44
00:03:31 --> 00:03:40
Now save the file with an extension <b>.cpp </b> (dot cpp) and click on Save.

45
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
Let us change the header file as <b>iostream</b>.

46
00:03:47 --> 00:03:57
Now  include the <b>using </b>statement. Click on save .

47
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
The  declaration of global variable and local variable is same in  C++.

48
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
So, no need to change anything.

49
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
Now replace the <b>printf </b>statement with the <b>cout</b> statement.

50
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
Delete the <b>format specifier</b> and '\n'.

51
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
Now delete the comma.

52
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
Type two opening angle brackets.

53
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Delete the closing bracket, again type two opening angle brackets.

54
00:04:26 --> 00:04:34
And within the double quotes type backslash n. Now click on Save.

55
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Let us execute the program.

56
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Come back to our terminal.

57
00:04:42 --> 00:04:51
To compile, type <b>g++ space scope dot cpp space -o space sco1 </b>

58
00:04:52 --> 00:05:03
Here we have <b>sco1</b> because we don't want to overwrite output parameter <b>sco</b> for the file 'scope.c'.

59
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Now press Enter.

60
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
To execute type <b>./sco1</b> and press Enter.

61
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
The output is displayed as  <b>Sum of a and b is 7.</b>

62
00:05:19 --> 00:05:26
We can see  that it is similar to our C code.

63
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.

64
00:05:31 --> 00:05:40
Come back to our program. Suppose here I will declare a  variable <b>a</b> again.

65
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
Type <b>int a </b> and a semicolon.

66
00:05:45 --> 00:05:54
Click on Save. We have declared  the variable 'a' above the main() function and after the <b>add</b> function.

67
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
Let us see what happens.

68
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Come back to our  terminal.

69
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Now compile as before.

70
00:06:05 --> 00:06:17
We see errors, <b>redefinition of 'int a' </b> , <b> 'int a' previously defined here</b>. Come back to our program.

71
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
<b>a</b> is a global variable.

72
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
It has a <b>global scope.</b>

73
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
We cannot declare the variable twice as it is already declared globally.

74
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
We can only declare <b>variable a</b> as a local variable .

75
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Let us fix the error.

76
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Delete this .

77
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
Click on Save.

78
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Let us execute again Come back to our terminal.

79
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Now compile as before, execute as before.

80
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
Yes, it is working.

81
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

82
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
Let us summarize.

83
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
In this tutorial we learnt ,

84
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
Scope of variable,

85
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
Global variable, e.gÂ : int a=5 &

86
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
and  local variable ,e.g:int sum

87
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
As an assignment,

88
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
write a program to print the difference of two numbers.

89
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
