Hello and welcome to the <b>spoken tutorial</b> on<b> Command Line Arguments.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
In this tutorial, we will learn about  <b>main()</b> function with <b>arguments</b>, with an example.

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:26
For this tutorial, I am using  <b>Ubuntu Operating system</b> version <b>11.10</b> and  <b>gcc Compiler</b> version <b>4.6.1</b> on Ubuntu.

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with <b>C</b> tutorials.

5
00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.

6
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
Let us start with our program. I have a code file. I will open it.

7
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
File name is <b>main hyphen with hyphen args.c</b>.

8
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
Let me explain the program.

9
00:00:53 --> 00:01:00
These are the <b>header</b> files. <b>stdio.h </b>defines <b>core input</b> and <b>output</b> functions.

10
00:01:01 --> 00:01:15
<b>stdlib.h header file</b> defines-
<p><b>Numeric conversion function</b>
<b>Pseudo-random numbers</b>
<b>Generation function</b>
<b>Memory allocation</b>
<b>Process control functions</b>.
</p>

11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:27
This is our <b>main()</b> function. Inside this, we have passed two arguments-
<p><b>int argc,  char  asterisk asterisk argv</b> (**argv).
</p>

12
00:01:28 --> 00:01:33
<b>argc</b> refers to the number of <b>command line arguments</b> passed to the program.

13
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
This includes the actual name of the program.

14
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
<b>argv</b> contains actual <b>argument</b>s starting from <b>index 0</b>.

15
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
<b>Index 0</b> is the name of the program.

16
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
<b>Index 1</b> will be the first <b>argument</b> passed to the program.

17
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
<b>Index 2</b> will be the second <b>argument</b> passed to the program and so on.

18
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
This statement will display the total number of <b>arguments</b> passed to the program.

19
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
This will display the first argument passed to the program.

20
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
<b>1</b> represents the <b>argument</b> at <b>index 1</b>.

21
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
'<b>while' condition</b> will decrement the number of arguments.

22
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
This statement will print all the <b>arguments</b> passed to the program.

23
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
At the end, we have<b> return 0 </b>statement.

24
00:02:27 --> 00:02:34
Let us open the <b>terminal</b> by pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt</b> and <b>T</b> keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

25
00:02:35 --> 00:02:48
Type:<b> gcc space main hyphen with hyphen args.c space hyphen o space args</b>. Press<b> Enter</b>.

26
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
Type:<b> dot slash args</b>. Press<b> Enter</b>.

27
00:02:54 --> 00:03:05
You can see the output as:
<p><b>"Total number of arguments are 1"</b>
</p><p><b>"The first argument is null"</b>
</p><p><b>"arguments are ./args"</b>
</p>

28
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
<b>Command line arguments </b> are given during execution.

29
00:03:11 --> 00:03:18
<b>Total number of arguments are 1</b> as the zeroth argument is the executable filename itself.

30
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
<b>The first argument is null </b>as we have not passed any argument to the program.

31
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
<b>Argument</b> is only one i.e. <b>dot slash args</b>.

32
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Now let us execute again.

33
00:03:34 --> 00:03:46
Press the up-arrow key <b>space</b> type: <b>Sunday space Monday space Tuesday</b>. Press <b>Enter</b>.

34
00:03:47 --> 00:04:03
Now we can see the output:
<p><b>Total number of arguments are 4 </b>
</p><p><b>The first argument is Sunday </b>
</p><p><b>Arguments are ./args </b> <b>Sunday Monday </b> and <b>Tuesday </b>.
</p>

35
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
Let me explain the output.

36
00:04:06 --> 00:04:13
Total number of arguments are 4 as- <b>./args, Sunday, Monday</b> and <b>Tuesday.</b>

37
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
The first argument is <b>Sunday</b>.

38
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
The zeroth argument always gives executable file-name.

39
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
<b>Sunday</b> is assigned to first argument.

40
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
<b>Monday</b> is assigned to second argument.

41
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
<b>Tuesday</b> is assigned to third argument.

42
00:04:31 --> 00:04:36
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

43
00:04:37 --> 00:04:44
In this tutorial, we learnt:
<p><b>Command line arguments</b>
<b>argc</b>
<b>argv</b>.
</p>

44
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
As an assignment, execute the program with different <b>argument</b>s.
