<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:08
Welcome to this <b>spoken tutorial</b> on <b>Report Writing</b> in <b>LaTeX</b>. I am calling it “<b>latek</b>” and not “<b>latex</b>”.

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
My name is Kannan Moudgalya.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:18
In this tutorial, we will learn how to write a document.

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:37
In particular, how to Use ‘<b>report</b>’ and ‘<b>article</b>’ <b>class</b>,
<p>How to create <b>sections</b>,
</p><p>Automate the numbering of sections,
</p><p>Create <b>Table of contents</b> and
</p><p>How to create the title page.
</p>

5
00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
I am creating this tutorial on our less than 10,000 Rupee laptop.

6
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
And, I am using <b>Ubuntu Linux, TeXworks</b> and <b>LaTeX.</b>

7
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
You can also use <b>TeXworks</b> on <b>Windows </b>or <b>Mac </b>- the method is identical.

8
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
You can use LaTeX by itself, without <b>TeXworks</b> also.

9
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
You are welcome to use more expensive Linux computers also!

10
00:01:07 --> 00:01:22
The prerequisites to learn this are the following:
<p>Spoken tutorials that introduce <b>LaTeX</b>,
</p><p>The file ‘<b>report dot tex’</b>,
</p><p>Knowledge of the <b>side-by-side method</b> required to practise this tutorial.
</p>

11
00:01:23 --> 00:01:31
Information on all of the above are available on our website: <b>spoken tutorial dot org</b>.

12
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
Let me go to the <b>TeXworks</b> window.

13
00:01:36 --> 00:01:43
I have already opened the file <b>report.tex</b>. Please download this file and practise along with me.

14
00:01:44 --> 00:01:54
I am using <b>12 point</b> as the font size, ‘a4 paper’ and <b>‘article’ class</b>.

15
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
I am using the <b>geometry package</b> to set margins, through the 'usepackage' command.

16
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
A <b>reverse slash</b> should come at the beginning of every command.

17
00:02:07 --> 00:02:12
Although I will not say it explicitly, you should not forget to put the reverse slash.

18
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
Similarly, I will not explicitly mention braces, but you may have to use them.

19
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
Please reproduce exactly what is done in the video.

20
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
The <b>usepackage</b> command has optional parameters inside square brackets.

21
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
The name of the package is within braces.

22
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
I have set horizontal and vertical margins of 4.5 cm each.

23
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
Look at the top left hand corner of the '<b>TexWorks</b>’ window.

24
00:02:47 --> 00:02:54
In case '<b>pdfLaTeX</b>’ is not already chosen, please select it from the pull down menu.

25
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
To the left, there is a green circle with an arrow.

26
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
Click the arrow and compile this file.

27
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
We get the file ‘report.pdf’ shown on the right hand side.

28
00:03:09 --> 00:03:17
Look at the titles - <b>section</b>, <b>sub-section</b> and <b>sub-sub-section</b> in the output file.

29
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
These are created using identical <b>commands</b> given in the <b>source file</b>.

30
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
Observe the distinctive features of these <b>section</b> titles in the 'pdf' file.

31
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
The sizes of these titles are created proportionately and automatically.

32
00:03:37 --> 00:03:44
Also, the <b>section</b> title is the largest and the <b>sub-sub-section</b> title is the smallest.

33
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
Irrespective of blank lines in the source file, the output remains the same.

34
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
Let me delete one line here. Compile.

35
00:03:55 --> 00:03:56
There is no change here.

36
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
Let me now change the paper size to <b>a5</b>.

37
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
This will reduce the width of every line in the output.

38
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
Let me compile the text as we did before.

39
00:04:10 --> 00:04:16
Let me magnify it by pressing control + so that you can see the output clearly.

40
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Let me bring it to the centre.

41
00:04:20 --> 00:04:27
For the rest of this tutorial, we will use the <b>a5</b> paper only.  You are welcome to change it to <b>a4</b>.

42
00:04:28 --> 00:04:36
Note that I did not <b>save</b> the file. This is because <b>TexWorks</b> saves the file automatically before compilation.

43
00:04:37 --> 00:04:43
Let us change the font to a smaller one of <b>10 point</b> and compile.

44
00:04:44 --> 00:04:53
Hey, the font size has become smaller - should we be surprised?  But, proportional sizing and spacing remain the same.

45
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
Let me change the font back to <b>12 point</b>.

46
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
We will now discuss another important aspect of <b>section titles</b>.

47
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
It is the automatic generation of <b>section</b> numbers.

48
00:05:09 --> 00:05:17
To illustrate this further, I will add a new <b>section</b> called ‘Inserted section’.

49
00:05:18 --> 00:05:28
On compilation, it appears here with a correct number in sequence. Thus, numbering also is automatically taken care of by LaTeX.

50
00:05:29 --> 00:05:35
LaTeX creates <b>table of contents</b> through a file with extension “<b>toc</b>”.

51
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
Let me add ‘table of contents’, one word, here.

52
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
Compile.

53
00:05:44 --> 00:05:49
The word ‘Contents’ appears in the output but nothing else.

54
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Let me compile once again.

55
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
All the titles are now present in the <b>table of contents</b> along with page numbers.

56
00:05:59 --> 00:06:04
You have to compile it the third time to get the correct page numbers.

57
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Why three times? Please see the assignment.

58
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
Just one word, ‘<b>table of contents</b>’, is what is needed.

59
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
What an amazing capability in LaTeX!

60
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
This is achieved through a file with extension “<b>toc</b>” that LaTeX maintains.

61
00:06:24 --> 00:06:29
This multi pass compilation procedure works with changes in titles as well.

62
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
Let me change the section title to ‘Modified section’.

63
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
Let me compile it. <b>Table of Contents</b> does not change.

64
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
Let me compile it once more and solve this problem.

65
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
Now we have a modified section here.

66
00:06:49 --> 00:06:56
We will create a title for this document. Let me do it here, just before ‘begin document’.

67
00:06:57 --> 00:07:12
I will create a ‘<b>title</b>’, ‘<b>Author</b>’ information and the ‘<b>date</b>’ as follows.

68
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
So, I have added these three commands.

69
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
Order in which these come or the place where they come does not matter.

70
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
But they should come before the <b>begin document</b> command.

71
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
Don’t forget the <b>reverse slash</b> in all the commands.

72
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
Double slash here means the next line. We compile it.

73
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
There are no changes in the ‘pdf’ file.

74
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
The reason is that I have not told LaTeX what to do with this information.

75
00:07:47 --> 00:07:54
So, I add the ‘make title’ command, one word, just after the 'begin document'.

76
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
Let me compile it.

77
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
The <b>title</b> appears in the output, at the place where I put this command

78
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
namely, at the beginning of the document.

79
00:08:07 --> 00:08:14
We will now change the <b>class</b> of this document from <b>article</b> to <b>report</b>.

80
00:08:15 --> 00:08:23
Simultaneously, we define a <b>chapter</b> with this command: 'Chapter First Chapter'.

81
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
<b>Report style</b> requires at least one <b>chapter</b>.

82
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
Let us compile it and see the output.

83
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
Notice the changes in the output.

84
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
Title appears on a whole page that has no number.

85
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
<b>Contents</b> also appear on an entire page, with page number 1.

86
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
Please pause here and find out how many entries in 'Contents' are wrong.

87
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
Let us go to the next page. Notice the way the <b>chapter</b> begins.

88
00:09:00 --> 00:09:07
How many distinguishing features can you identify? You should find at least five.

89
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
Let us compile it for the second time.

90
00:09:12 --> 00:09:20
Observe that the <b>Contents</b> page now has the correct information. The page numbers are correct now.

91
00:09:21 --> 00:09:31
Let us add a <b>chapter</b>, called ‘New Chapter’.

92
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
Compile it.

93
00:09:34 --> 00:09:46
Let me compile once again and see it coming on a new page.

94
00:09:47 --> 00:09:52
Insert the command <b>appendix</b> before this new <b>chapter</b>.

95
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
On compilation, you see the word “<b>Appendix</b>” appearing.

96
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
The <b>chapter</b> number is <b>A</b>.

97
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Let us go to the <b>slide</b>s now.

98
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Let us summarize what we learnt in this tutorial.

99
00:10:08 --> 00:10:20

100
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Let me give some assignments.

101
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
This assignment is on <b>a4</b> paper and <b>letter paper</b>.

102
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
Please pause the video, read the slide and do the assignment.

103
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40

104
00:10:41 --> 00:10:46
This is on <b>report dot toc.</b>

105
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
This is on number of compilations.

106
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
This is on the location of <b>Table of Contents</b>.

107
00:10:59 --> 00:11:06

109
00:11:15 --> 00:11:21
This is the same as the previous assignment, but in the '<b>article' class</b>.

110
