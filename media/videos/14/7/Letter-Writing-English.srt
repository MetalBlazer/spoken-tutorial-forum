<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to this tutorial on how to write letters using latex.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
You can see three windows.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
These correspond to the three distinct phases in typesetting through latex:

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:21
creation of <b>source file</b>, compilation to produce the pdf file and viewing it through a <b>pdf reader</b>.

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:33
I am using the free pdf reader “Skim” in Mac OSX because it automatically loads the latest pdf file after every compilation.

6
00:00:34 --> 00:00:41
There are pdf browsers in Linux and also in Windows that have this capability.

7
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Let us go through the <b>source file</b> and see what each <b>command</b> does.

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
The first line says that this belongs to 'letter document' class.

9
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
<b>12 point</b> is the text size.

10
00:00:57 --> 00:01:06
The first component of the letter is the ‘from address’. It appears between the braces here.

11
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
The result of this is seen in the top right hand corner of the output file.

12
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Two consecutive slashes start a new line.

13
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
If I remove the double slashes from here –

14
00:01:25 --> 00:01:36
<b>save</b>, compile using pdflatex –

15
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
you can see that these two lines get merged in one line.

16
00:01:43 --> 00:01:48
Previously with a double slash we asked latex to split the line.

17
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
Now these reverse slashes are no longer there, so latex does not know that it has to break the line there.

18
00:01:56 --> 00:02:03
Let me put the slashes back.

19
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
<b>Save</b>, Compile.

20
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
It is to be understood that after every change we need to <b>save</b> before compilation.

21
00:02:15 --> 00:02:20
Let us see what happens when we give an empty address.

22
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Let me just come here,

23
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
mark it,

24
00:02:27 --> 00:02:36
go to the end of the line, delete it, save it, compile it.

25
00:02:37 --> 00:02:43
You can see that the from address has disappeared from here.

26
00:02:44 --> 00:02:53
Note that today’s date appears automatically in American style: month, date and then year.

27
00:02:54 --> 00:03:01
This is obtained through the command <b>slash date slash today</b>.

28
00:03:02 --> 00:03:11
We can prevent the automatic appearance of the date with an empty list, as we do now.

29
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
Save.

30
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
Compile,The date has gone.

31
00:03:20 --> 00:03:29
Suppose that we want to put our own date, let us enter it with date first as follows.

32
00:03:30 --> 00:03:39
9th July 2007, Save, Compile.

33
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Got the date.

34
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
This is the date on which this tutorial was created the first time.

35
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
On compiling it, we see this Indian format appearing in the output file.

36
00:03:53 --> 00:04:01
Let us put the address back.

37
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
And the document is back to the previous state by recompiling.

38
00:04:08 --> 00:04:16
The <b>signature</b> command's argument appears at the bottom of the letter.

39
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
We begin the document and then the letter.

40
00:04:22 --> 00:04:29
The ‘to address’ comes first. It appears in the top left hand corner of the output.

41
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
I have addressed this to Mr. N. K. Sinha.

42
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
The command ‘slash opening’ is used to address the recipient.

43
00:04:40 --> 00:04:47
You may have already noticed that all latex commands begin with a reverse slash.

44
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
The text of the letter comes next.

45
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
One starts a new paragraph in latex through a blank line as we show now.

46
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
Let me come here. Right now this sentence starting at ‘we are’ is here.

47
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
Let’s open. Let's take this to the next line.

48
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
I have left a blank line. Let me <b>save</b> this.

49
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
Compile this.

50
00:05:19 --> 00:05:24
You can see that this has gone to a new paragraph.

51
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
With a new paragraph, the letter has gone to two pages.

52
00:05:29 --> 00:05:36
Let us see if the <b>font size</b> is reduced to 10, we can bring the letter back to one page.

53
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
Let me do that now.

54
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
Save.

55
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
Compile,You can see that the whole letter has come into one page.

56
00:05:54 --> 00:05:59
Let me put this back to <b>12 pt</b>.

57
00:06:00 --> 00:06:05
And let me also remove this paragraph bit.

58
00:06:06 --> 00:06:11
And let me compile this.

59
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Okay.

60
00:06:14 --> 00:06:28
I now want to explain the itemize environment which is created with a pair of 'begin' and 'end itemize' <b>commands</b>.

61
00:06:29 --> 00:06:36
Every piece of text that starts with a ‘slash item’ appears in a bulleted form.

62
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
Can I get numbers in the place of bullets here?

63
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
You just have to change the "itemize" into "enumerate" as I do now.

64
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
Let me just change this to "enumerate".

65
00:06:53 --> 00:06:59
<b>Save</b> it.

66
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
Of course! It is always a good idea to save as often as possible.

67
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
Let me compile this again.

68
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
You can see that the bullets have become numbers now.

69
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
In closing, I have included, ‘Yours sincerely’ which comes here.

70
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
We have already talked about the signature.

71
00:07:26 --> 00:07:34
Finally, the command 'cc' helps mark this letter to other recipients.

72
00:07:35 --> 00:07:43
I end the letter with ‘end letter’ command and then the document is completed with the ‘end document’ command.

73
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
Feel free to modify the content and try them out.

74
00:07:48 --> 00:07:57
Until you become confident, change only one thing at a time and make sure by immediate compilation that whatever you have done is correct.

75
00:07:58 --> 00:08:09
Although I talked about the letter writing process in a Mac, the same source file will work in all Latex systems including those in Linux and Windows operating systems.

76
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

77
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
Thanks for listening,This is Kannan Moudgalya from CDEEP, IIT Bombay, signing off. Good bye.
