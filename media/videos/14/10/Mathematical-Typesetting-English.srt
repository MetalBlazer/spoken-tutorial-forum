<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to this <b>spoken tutorial</b> on <b>Mathematical Typesetting</b> in <b>LaTeX</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
My name is Kannan Moudgalya.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:14
A reminder: we should call it LaTeX and not latex.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
In this tutorial, we will learn how to create mathematical symbols in LaTeX.

5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:28
In particular, how to get into and leave from the mathematical mode. The role of <b>space</b>s and creating them,

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
Mathematical symbols.

7
00:00:31 --> 00:00:36
Finally, <b>A M S math package</b> and its use in creating <b>matrices</b>.

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
I am creating this tutorial on our less than 10,000 Rupee laptop.

9
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
I am using <b>Ubuntu, TeXworks</b> and <b>LaTeX.</b>

10
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
The prerequisites are the following- basic spoken tutorials on LaTeX,

11
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
exposure to the <b>side-by-side </b>tutorial.

12
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
All are available from our website.

13
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
I shall use the file 'maths.tex'.

14
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
It is available as a code file in our web page where you found this tutorial.

15
00:01:11 --> 00:01:16
In the same location, you will find this 'pdf' file from the <b>TeX user group, India</b>.

16
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
We shall use it when we do assignments

17
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
Let me go to the ‘TeXworks’ window.

18
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
I have already opened the file 'maths.tex'.

19
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
Please download this file and practise along with me.

20
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
We have already seen the commands that are at the top of this file.

21
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
This command removes the <b>paragraph indent</b>.

22
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
We will study the effect of this statement through an assignment.

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
Let us start with Greek symbols that are used in mathematics.

24
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
We use <b>dollar</b> sign to get into mathematical mode in LaTeX.

25
00:01:57 --> 00:02:05
Let us begin with <b>alpha</b>. We write <b> dollar back slash alpha dollar</b>.

26
00:02:06 --> 00:02:14
Let us compile and see that we get the Greek letter <b>alpha</b> in the 'pdf'.

27
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
The first dollar says that we are getting into the mathematical mode.

28
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
The second dollar says that we are leaving this mode.

29
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
From now on, I will not explicitly mention dollar or the back slash.

30
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
But you have to do exactly what you see on the screen.

31
00:02:34 --> 00:02:49
Similarly we write <b>beta, gamma</b> and <b>delta</b>. Let us compile.

32
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
I did not save the 'tex' file, as <b>TeXworks</b> does it automatically.

33
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Let us delete these.

34
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
We will next take up the concept of <b>space</b>s in mathematical expressions.

35
00:03:05 --> 00:03:11
How do we generate <b>alpha a</b>, that is, the product of <b>alpha</b> and 'a'?

36
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
Let us try 'alpha a'.

37
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Let me compile.

38
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26
'LaTeX' complains that 'alpha a' is an undefined control sequence.

39
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
It says that it does not understand this command. Let me close this.

40
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
LaTeX handles this through a <b>space</b> after every command.

41
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
Let us leave a <b>space</b> after 'alpha'.

42
00:03:44 --> 00:03:51
Let us abort the compilation. Let's recompile; this has solved the problem.

43
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
As it is used to terminate a command, the <b>space</b> does not appear in 'pdf'.

44
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
What do we do if we WANT to introduce <b>spaces</b> in the output?

45
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
We have to explicitly tell LaTeX, as we do now.

46
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
Let us ask LaTeX to start a new line.

47
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
Let us write <b>alpha backslash space a</b>.

48
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Compile it.

49
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
This has created a <b>space</b>.

50
00:04:23 --> 00:04:30
If you want more <b>space</b>, use 'quad', as we do now.

51
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
Compile it.

52
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
You can see that 'quad' has left a large <b>space</b>.

53
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
We will now move to another topic.

54
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
Let us delete the last two lines. Let’s compile.

55
00:04:50 --> 00:04:55
What happens to the font when we go from the text to the mathematical mode?

56
00:04:56 --> 00:05:03
To understand this, let us write “Product of $\alpha and a is”.

57
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Compile.

58
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
You can see that the font of these two 'a' s are different.

59
00:05:14 --> 00:05:24
This is solved by writing this 'a' also inside <b>dollar</b> signs.

60
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
Let me compile.

61
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
Now the fonts of these  two 'a' s are identical.

62
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
Not keeping the font of variables identical is a common mistake.

63
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
Let’s get rid of these.

64
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Let’s compile.

65
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
Let us now discuss a rule for creating minus signs.

66
00:05:48 --> 00:05:57
Suppose that we want to create <b>minus alpha</b> and compile.

67
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
Let’s compile.

68
00:06:01 --> 00:06:06
Notice that the minus sign appears as a small dash here.

69
00:06:07 --> 00:06:14
Let us also copy with the minus sign, inside the dollar sign.

70
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
Let us compile again.

71
00:06:18 --> 00:06:26
See the difference in the minus sign now. The second one is what we need, the dash is not to be used.

72
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
Not putting the minus sign within dollars is a common mistake made by beginners.

73
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Let us delete all of these.

74
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
Next we would like to explain the 'frac' command that is used to create fractions.

75
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
'frac a b'. Let's compile.

76
00:06:50 --> 00:06:59
It generates 'a' by 'b'. The command 'frac' is terminated by a <b>space</b>. It looks for two <b>arguments</b>.

77
00:07:00 --> 00:07:06
The first character 'a' is taken as the first <b>argument</b>. It becomes the numerator.

78
00:07:07 --> 00:07:12
The second character 'b' is taken as the second <b>argument</b>; it becomes the denominator.

79
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
Notice that the size of 'a' and 'b' gets reduced automatically.

80
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
What do we do if we have longer characters?

81
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
What if we want to create 'ab' by 'cd'? I want you to try this.

82
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
In LaTeX, the <b>arguments</b> longer than one character are enclosed by braces.

83
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
For example, let us put braces here.

84
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
When we compile this, we get the desired output.

85
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
All the entries within the braces are taken as a single <b>argument</b>.

86
00:07:52 --> 00:08:00
As a result, one can enter any complicated expression within braces. Let us delete all of these.

87
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Now we will look at subscripts and superscripts.

88
00:08:05 --> 00:08:13
<b>x underscore a</b> creates <b>x sub a</b>.

89
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
The size of 'a' gets automatically reduced to an appropriate level.

90
00:08:19 --> 00:08:27
What if we want to put 'ab' as the subscript? you have to use braces. Try it yourself.

91
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
Superscripts are created by the <b>caret</b> or the <b>up arrow</b> symbol.

92
00:08:33 --> 00:08:42
For example, if you want to create 'x' to the power 3, you will write: <b>x up arrow 3</b>.

93
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
We can also put subscripts and superscripts simultaneously.

94
00:08:48 --> 00:08:57
Let us put <b>x sub a superscript b</b>; let’s compile.

95
00:08:58 --> 00:09:07
Once again, using braces, we can produce complicated subscripts and superscripts. Let me delete this.

96
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
Alright.. next we will move onto <b>Matrices</b>.

97
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
The package <b>a m s math</b> has some matrix definitions that I like.

98
00:09:19 --> 00:09:25
Let us include it through the 'usepackage' command.

99
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
The <b>ampersand</b>, that is, the '<b>and'</b> symbol is used to separate the columns.

100
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
Let us create a matrix now.

101
00:09:34 --> 00:09:43
We write 'begin matrix' 'a' and 'b', 'end matrix'. Don’t forget the dollar signs.

102
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
Compile and see the matrix, as expected.

103
00:09:49 --> 00:09:58
Now suppose, we want to add a second row to this, we put two <b>back slashes</b>, meaning, go to the next line.

104
00:09:59 --> 00:10:10
Suppose that we want three entries in the second row, say, 'c, d, e'. Compile it and see the second row also included now.

105
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
Supposing we change matrix to 'pmatrix', at 'begin' and 'end'.

106
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
Compile and get this.

107
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
It is now time for you to start exploring.  Let us go to the slides now.

108
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Let us summarise what we learnt in this tutorial-

109
00:10:31 --> 00:10:36
Entering and leaving the mathematical mode Using <b>space</b>s and creating them

110
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
Fractions, subscripts and superscripts Defining an <b>argument</b> with in braces

111
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
'amsmath' package to create matrices.

112
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
Let me give some assignments.

113
00:10:51 --> 00:11:00
This assignment is on <b>spaces</b> - large and small, please pause the video, read the slide and do the assignment.

114
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
This assignment is on fractions using braces.

115
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
This assignment is on subscripts and superscripts.

116
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
Through this assignment, we shall learn a few more methods to create matrices.

117
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
This assignment is on creating more mathematical symbols.

118
00:11:21 --> 00:11:28
This is based on the <b>TUG India LaTeX</b> guide. Let us see that document now.

119
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
I already asked you to download this document from our web page.

120
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
You will reproduce some symbols given in this document.

121
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
You will try out more symbols through in the next assignment.

122
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
This assignment is also based on the <b>TUG India</b> document.

123
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
You will experiment with the paragraph indent in this assignment.

124
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

125
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
