00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Dear Friends, Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>“LaTeX on Windows using TeXworks”</b>

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:11
In this tutorial we will learn to,  Download and install <b>MikTeX</b> .

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Write basic <b>LaTeX</b> documents using <b>TeXworks</b>.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
Configure <b>MikTeX</b> to download missing packages.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:26
To record this tutorial, I am using <b>Windows7 </b>operating system and MikTeX2.9

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Let us now see the salient features of <b>TeXworks</b>

7
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
It is platform independent

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
It has an embedded pdf reader

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
It supports Indian language typesetting

10
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
Before we start with <b>TeXworks</b>, we have to install <b>MikTeX</b>.

11
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
<b>MikTeX</b> is an up-to-date implementation of <b>TeX/LaTeX</b> and related programs for <b>Windows</b>.

12
00:00:52 --> 00:01:03
It contains the necessary packages to create basic documents in <b>LaTeX </b>on <b>Windows</b> ,Moreover, <b>TeXworks</b> is a default editor available with <b>MikTeX</b> installation.

13
00:01:04 --> 00:01:09
Go to the website <a class="external text" href="http://www.miktex.org/" rel="nofollow">www.</a><b>miktex</b><a class="external text" href="http://www.miktex.org/" rel="nofollow">.org</a>

14
00:01:10 --> 00:01:18
Click on the download link for recommended <b>MikTeX</b> installer. This will download the <b>MikTeX</b> installer.

15
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
Download and save it on your <b>Desktop.</b>.

16
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
It is a large file, about 154 mega bytes. Hence, it will take some time to download.

17
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
I have already downloaded this file. Here it is.

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
Double click on this file to start the installation.

19
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Check the check box and click on <b>Next</b>.

20
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
Choose all default options.

21
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
The installation will take around 5 to 10 minutes.

22
00:01:47 --> 00:01:54
I have already installed <b>MikTeX</b> on my computer. Hence I will not proceed with the installation.

23
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
After successfully installing <b>MikTeX</b> on your computer,

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
let us see how to use the <b>TeXworks</b> editor which comes with <b>MikTeX.</b>

25
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Click on the <b>Windows start</b> button.

26
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
Click on <b>All Programs</b>.

27
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Click on <b>MikTeX2.9</b>.

28
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Click on <b>TeXworks</b>.

29
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
<b>TeXworks</b> editor will open.

30
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
Let me open an already existing <b>LaTeX</b> document.

31
00:02:22 --> 00:02:32
I will click on <b>File,</b> then click on <b>Open</b> and choose the directory. Then I will open the file <b>hello.tex</b>.

32
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
You can see that the text written in the file is colored.

33
00:02:38 --> 00:02:46
This is called <b>syntax</b> <b>highlighting</b>.  It helps the user differentiate between the user content and the <b>LaTeX</b> syntax.

34
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
In case the <b>LaTeX</b> syntax is not highlighted, do the following.

35
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
In the <b>TeXworks</b> window, click on <b>Format</b> button available on the <b>Menu bar</b>.

36
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Select <b>Syntax Colouring</b> and then click on <b>LaTeX</b>.

37
00:03:03 --> 00:03:10
If you want <b>TeXworks</b> to apply <b>syntax highlighting</b> every time you create a <b>LaTeX</b> document, do the following

38
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
On the <b>menu</b> bar, click on <b>Edit</b> and then click on <b>Preferences</b>.

39
00:03:16 --> 00:03:21
In the <b>Editor</b> tab, click on the dropdown button which gives options for <b>Syntax Colouring</b>.

40
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
Choose <b>LaTeX</b> and then click on <b>Ok.</b>

41
00:03:27 --> 00:03:32
In this way, <b>syntax</b> <b>highlighting</b> will be applied to all documents created in the future.

42
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Now we are ready to compile our <b>LaTeX</b> document.

43
00:03:37 --> 00:03:42
Press <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>t</b> keys together to start the compilation.

44
00:03:43 --> 00:03:48
Once the document is compiled without errors, the resulting <b>pdf</b> will be opened.

45
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Note that this <b>pdf</b> reader comes along with <b>TeXworks.</b>

46
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
It is the default <b>pdf</b> reader used by <b>TeXworks</b> to display the compiled <b>pdf</b> documents.

47
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
We have completed the basic installation of LATEX.

48
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
This is sufficient for many formatting requirements.

49
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
You may now leave this tutorial. Practice the remaining LATEX tutorials on the playlist

50
00:04:14 --> 00:04:24
While practising other tutorials, you may get the following error message:<b>“The required file ABC is missing. It is a part of the following package: XYZ”</b>

51
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
Here ABC is a file inside the package XYZ

52
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
ABC and XYZ will be specific to your case.

53
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
When you get such an error message, listen to the rest of this tutorial.

54
00:04:38 --> 00:04:45
Two ways to solve that problem are explained in the rest of this tutorial. At least one of them should work for you.

55
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
Goodbye for now

56
00:04:48 --> 00:04:55
Do you want to know how to solve a problem of the following type: Listen to the rest of this tutorial and practise with me.

57
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Now let us compile a <b>Beamer</b> document.

58
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
Beamer package by default is not included in the <b>MikTeX</b> setup that we have installed.

59
00:05:05 --> 00:05:11
This means that we have to : download it from some source and add it to our current <b>MikTeX</b> distribution

60
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
There are two ways of installing a missing package.

61
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
One way is to install it on the fly while we are compiling a <b>LaTeX</b> document

62
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
This <b>LaTeX</b> document will typically require a package not available in your <b>MikTeX</b> distribution.

63
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
Other way, is to manually choose and install a package using <b>Package</b> <b>Manager</b> of <b>MikTeX</b>.

64
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
Let us see the first method.

65
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
We will  open and compile a <b>LaTeX</b> document, which requires <b>MikTeX</b>  to install packages from the <b>internet</b>.

66
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
First close the <b>TeXworks</b> editor.

67
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
It is required that we open the <b>tex</b> file with administrator privileges.

68
00:05:53 --> 00:06:01
Click on the <b>start</b> button. Then click on <b>All programs</b>. Click on <b>MikTeX2.9</b>

69
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
Right click on <b>TeXworks</b> and choose <b>Run as Administrator</b>

70
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
This will launch the <b>TeXworks</b> editor with <b>administrator</b> privileges.

71
00:06:13 --> 00:06:20
Now click on <b>File.</b> Then click on <b>Open</b>  Choose the file <b>beamer.tex</b>

72
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
Press <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>t</b> keys together to start the compilation.

73
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
A <b>Package Installation </b>dialog box will open.

74
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
It will ask to install the missing package <b>beamer.cls. </b>

75
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
Click on <b>Change </b>button on this dialog box.

76
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
<b>Change Package Repository </b>dialog box will open.

77
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
Choose the option <b>Packages shall be installed from the internet.</b>

78
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
Click on <b>Connection Settings.</b>

79
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
It will prompt you to configure the <b>proxy</b> settings.

80
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
If you are not on a <b>proxy</b> network then leave the <b>Use proxy server checkbox</b> unchecked.

81
00:07:03 --> 00:07:08
Since i am on a <b>proxy</b> network, i will enable the option by clicking on the checkbox

82
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
I will enter the <b>proxy</b> address.

83
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
I will enter <b>proxy</b> port number.

84
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
I will enable the option <b>Authentication required </b>by clicking on the corresponding checkbox

85
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
Click on <b>Ok</b>. And then click on <b>Next</b>

86
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
It will ask me the <b>proxy username </b>and<b> password.</b>

87
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
I will enter the information and click on <b>OK</b>.

88
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
It will show a list of various remote package repositories.

89
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Choose one from the list and click on <b>Finish.</b>

90
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Click on <b>Install</b>.

91
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
It will install the <b>beamer.cls </b>package

92
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
Once again the <b>Package Installation </b>dialog box will open.

93
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
It will prompt to install the missing package <b>pgfcore.sty.</b>

94
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
You may uncheck the option <b>Always show this dialog before installing packages</b>.

95
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
If you do this, <b>MikTeX</b> will not prompt you again, if it encounters a missing package.

96
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Click on <b>Install.</b>

97
00:08:18 --> 00:08:27
Now if there any more missing packages, it will automatically install it, without asking for your permission.

98
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
Once the installation completes, it will finish the compilation and open the <b>pdf</b> output.

99
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
We can see that we have successfully compiled a <b>Beamer</b> document.

100
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
Now let us see the second method of installing missing packages.

101
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
Click on the Windows <b>start</b> button.

102
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
Click on <b>All Programs</b>.

103
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Click on <b>MikTeX2.9</b>

104
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
Click on <b>Maintenance (Admin)</b>

105
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
Cick on <b>Package Manager (Admin)</b>

106
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
It will show a list of various packages available.

107
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
Now let us take a look at this list.

108
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
There are six columns in this list.

109
00:09:10 --> 00:09:17
These are <b>Name, Category, Size, Packaged date, Installed on date</b> and <b>Title</b>.

110
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
The <b>Installed on</b> column is very important to us.

111
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
The packages for which this column is blank indicates that these packages are not installed.

112
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
Let us see how to install a particular package.

113
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
Let me choose the package <b>abc</b>, for example.

114
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
Notice that the moment I choose the package, the <b>plus</b> button on the top left side gets enabled.

115
00:09:45 --> 00:09:49
The <b>plus</b> button is the <b>install</b> button. Click on the <b>plus</b> button.

116
00:09:50 --> 00:09:57
A window will open which will list the number of packages you have chosen to install or uninstall.

117
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Click on <b>Proceed</b>.

118
00:10:01 --> 00:10:07
Since I have configured a <b>proxy</b> network connection, it will prompt me for the <b>proxy username</b> and <b>password</b>.

119
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Let me type my <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>

120
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
Click on <b>Ok</b>

121
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
A window will open which will show the download progress of the package selected for installation.

122
00:10:20 --> 00:10:25
It may happen that it fails to download the requested package due to remote server connectivity issues.

123
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
In that case, change the package repository and try again.

124
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
We can see that the installation of selected package is completed.

125
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
Click on <b>Close</b>.

126
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
The package list will get refreshed.

127
00:10:41 --> 00:10:48
Notice that 11 september 2013 appears in the <b>Installed</b> <b>on</b> column for package <b>abc.</b>

128
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
This completes the tutorial <b>LaTeX on Windows using TeXworks</b>

129
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
In this tutorial we learnt to -  Download and install <b>MikTeX</b>.

130
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
Write a basic <b>LaTeX</b> document using <b>TeXworks</b>

131
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
