<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
Welcome to this tutorial on <b>Tables and Figures</b>.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
We have two objectives in this tutorial.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:21
The first one is to explain how to create <b>tables</b> using the tabular environment; the second objective is to explain how to include tables in latex documents using the <b>table environment</b>.

4
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
A similar technique can be used to include figures also.

5
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
We have seen how to create the title page,

6
00:00:32 --> 00:00:44
this one has title, author information, and Creative Commons, copyright information as explained in the tutorial on <b>equations</b>.

7
00:00:45 --> 00:00:50
Today’s date appears in the last column created by this <b>command</b>.

8
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
Let us go to the second page.

9
00:00:58 --> 00:01:04
I will now explain to you, how to create this table in a step-by-step fashion.

10
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
Let us start with a clean slate.

11
00:01:08 --> 00:01:18
Let me delete these commands.

12
00:01:19 --> 00:01:28
I will compile this and start with a clean slate.

13
00:01:29 --> 00:01:37
The <b>tabular environment</b> is created using <b>begin tabular</b> and <b>end tabular</b> commands.

14
00:01:38 --> 00:02:02
Let me do that here.

15
00:02:03 --> 00:02:13
The ‘r r’ characters within the braces, next to the <b>begin tabular</b>, say that there are two <b>columns</b> and that they are right aligned.

16
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
In the first line, the entries are "mango" and "mixed".

17
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
Two reverse-slashes indicate next line.

18
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Let me enter the next line.

19
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
"Jackfruit".

20
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
"Kolli hills".

21
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
"Banana".

22
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
"Green".

23
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
Let me end this <b>tabular environment</b>.

24
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
Let me compile this.

25
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
And, this has appeared here.

26
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
We get the <b>3 by 2 table</b>. There are three rows and 2 columns.

27
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
The two columns are <b>right aligned</b> as indicated by the 'r r' character.

28
00:03:09 --> 00:03:19
To separate the two columns, we introduce a vertical line between the column alignment characters.

29
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
So, let me put that vertical line.

30
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
<b>Save</b> it,Compile it.

31
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
You see that a vertical line has come.

32
00:03:31 --> 00:03:41
If you want vertical lines at the end also, put them at appropriate places.

33
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
Let me put them, save them, compile them.

34
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
So, these have come.

35
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
As a matter of fact, we can put more vertical lines.

36
00:03:54 --> 00:04:01
Let me put one more vertical line at the beginning.

37
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
There you are! A second line has come.

38
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
See there are two vertical lines.

39
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
We will now try different alignments.

40
00:04:15 --> 00:04:26
Let's put a ‘c’ here to say that the second column should be <b>center aligned</b>.

41
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
This is <b>center aligned</b> now.

42
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Let us make the first column <b>left aligned</b>.

43
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
Right now, it is <b>right aligned</b>; let me make them <b>left aligned</b>.

44
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
'l',<b>Save</b>

45
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Compile.

46
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
Now it is <b>left aligned</b>.

47
00:04:50 --> 00:04:55
We will now separate the rows with horizontal lines as follows.

48
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
Let's put a <b>h-line</b> here.

49
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
Let us see what happens when we do that.

50
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
It puts a top line.

51
00:05:07 --> 00:05:15
If I put another <b>h-line</b> here,

52
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
see a line has come,So, let me complete this.

53
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Let me put <b>h-line</b>.

54
00:05:22 --> 00:05:29
Here I have to put a <b>break line</b> with two <b>reverse slashes</b> and then <b>h-line</b>.

55
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
<b>H-line</b> begins from the beginning of the sentence.

56
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
So, now I have completed the horizontal lines.

57
00:05:42 --> 00:05:48
Now, let us add three more columns and one more row.

58
00:05:49 --> 00:06:00
So, what I do is- I come here, and 'c' , 'c', 'r'.

59
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
So, I have added three more columns, first two of them are <b>center aligned</b> the third one is <b>right aligned</b>.

60
00:06:08 --> 00:06:14
And then here I want to say:

61
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
"fruit"

62
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
"type"

63
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
"number of units"

64
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
"cost per unit"

65
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
"cost rupees"

66
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
<b>h-line</b>.

67
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
So, "mixed"

68
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
"20"

69
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
"75" rupees

70
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
"1500" rupees.

71
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
"Jackfruit"

72
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
"10" of them

73
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
"50" rupees

74
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
"500" rupees.

75
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
"Banana green"

76
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
"10" dozens

77
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
"20" rupees a dozen and "200" rupees total.

78
00:07:12 --> 00:07:19
So, let’s see whether we can compile this.

79
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
So, it has created the table.

80
00:07:25 --> 00:07:33
See the need for <b>right alignment</b>, this is.. so that we can add these numbers.

81
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
Suppose, that we want to split the columns in two.

82
00:07:39 --> 00:07:47
For example, here these two columns have fruit details and these three have cost calculations.

83
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
So, this is done with the help of what is known as <b>multi-column command</b>.

84
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
Let me do it as follows.

85
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
<b>multi-column</b>

86
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
take 2

87
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
<b>center-aligned</b>

88
00:08:10 --> 00:08:11
<b>Fruit Details</b>.

89
00:08:12 --> 00:08:18
First two are over then I put a <b>tab</b> to indicate the next column.

90
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
Go to the next line.

91
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
<b>multi-column</b>, three, also to be <b>center-aligned</b>.

92
00:08:29 --> 00:08:36
Cost within braces – <b>cost calculations</b>

93
00:08:37 --> 00:08:43
<b>slash h-line</b>.

94
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
So, there you are.

95
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
The first two have the title "Fruit details", the next three have the title "Cost calculations".

96
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
I don’t have the vertical lines that’s because I didn’t tell latex to do that. So let’s do that.

97
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
Here, I want two vertical lines, here I want one vertical line.

98
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
Before this, I already have the line here, so let me just put this here.

99
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
See what happens.

100
00:09:16 --> 00:09:23
So, now the vertical lines have also come.

101
00:09:24 --> 00:09:39
Because these 2 and 3 are single character <b>arguments</b> its possible to write them without braces.

102
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
Okay, same thing works.

103
00:09:42 --> 00:09:51
Sometimes it is necessary to draw horizontal lines between only a few columns.

104
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
So, we explain this as follows.

105
00:09:54 --> 00:10:04
Let me split this "mango" instead of "mixed", let me call this "Malgoa"

106
00:10:05 --> 00:10:12
and then "18" kilograms

107
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
"50" kilograms.

108
00:10:17 --> 00:10:22
Let me delete this.

109
00:10:23 --> 00:10:32
okay,And here, let me say that it is "Alfanso"

110
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
"2" dozens

111
00:10:35 --> 00:10:43
"300" rupees a dozen, and a total of 1500.

112
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49
Let’s see what happens when I <b>save</b> this. Compile this.

113
00:10:50 --> 00:11:18
So, I’ve got this. What happens is, this line comes here and as well as here and I don’t want this and this. So, this is taken care of by saying instead of this horizontal line, I want a 'c' line and between the columns 2 and 4.

114
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
So, I should have done this here.

115
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
So let me put this back here.

116
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
<b>H-line</b> here.

117
00:11:30 --> 00:11:39
<b>c-line 2 to 4</b>.

118
00:11:40 --> 00:11:51
Okay, so now I have the line between columns two and four only.

119
00:11:52 --> 00:11:57
So, this central line has split the mangoes into two of the most popular mangoes in India.

120
00:11:58 --> 00:12:03
We will conclude this example, conclude this <b>table</b> with a last row.

121
00:12:04 --> 00:12:10
Let me total up as follows.

122
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
<b>multi-column</b> four

123
00:12:14 --> 00:12:19
2 vertical lines, <b>right-aligned</b>

124
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
vertical separator

125
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
<b>Total cost</b>

126
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
Rupees.

127
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
Close this.

128
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Next tab

129
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
2200

130
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
<b>h-line</b>.

131
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
So there you are.

132
00:12:50 --> 00:12:58
So, this was the <b>table</b> that we started with at the beginning of this tutorial.

133
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
How do we work with the <b>tables</b> created using the <b>tabular environment</b>?

134
00:13:04 --> 00:13:09
Latex treats the entire table created using the <b>tabular environment</b> as a single object.

135
00:13:10 --> 00:13:16
For example- if you write,

136
00:13:17 --> 00:13:23
This is

137
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
an

138
00:13:27 --> 00:13:38
example

139
00:13:39 --> 00:13:46
<b>"This is an example table"</b>.

140
00:13:47 --> 00:13:55
What happens is this <b>table</b> gets sandwiched between these two. "This is an" example to, "example table".

141
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
This <b>table</b> appears in a running sentence.

142
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
It is possible to include tables using a <b>centre environment</b>.

143
00:14:05 --> 00:14:17
A more common approach is to include it in the <b>table environment</b>. As we show now.

144
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
<b>begin</b>

145
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
<b>table</b>

146
00:14:25 --> 00:14:32
Close this.

147
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
So, what happens is now ‘this is an example table’.

148
00:14:36 --> 00:14:49
This statement comes separately and whatever that appeared between this ‘begin’ and ‘end’ table have been placed separately as a <b>table</b>.

149
00:14:50 --> 00:14:56
In other words, even though the table appears in between some text, it has been put separately.

150
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
This is not centered.

151
00:14:59 --> 00:15:07
What I can do is, give a command here called <b>‘centering’</b>

152
00:15:08 --> 00:15:16
to place this at the center of the document.

153
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
Let us now create a <b>caption</b>.

154
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
<b>Table caption</b> is put before the table.

155
00:15:23 --> 00:15:30
Let me put a caption here.

156
00:15:31 --> 00:15:41
<b> "Caption cost of fruits in India"</b>.

157
00:15:42 --> 00:15:43
So, the <b>caption</b> has come.

158
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
This is too close; I want to leave a small space.

159
00:15:47 --> 00:15:56
Let me do that by giving through this <b>v-space</b> command <b>1 ex</b>.

160
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
That is the space equivalent of the ‘x’ character.

161
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
So, I have left this vertical space.

162
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
So, now it looks okay.

163
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
By default, Latex places tables at the top of the page.

164
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
This placement is done automatically.

165
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
The table is ‘floated’ to the next available slot.

166
00:16:18 --> 00:16:24
To explain this, let me cut and paste some text from the bottom of this document.

167
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Let me delete this.

168
00:16:28 --> 00:16:37
Let me delete this.

169
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
Alright.

170
00:16:43 --> 00:16:48
Now, there is some write up about these fruits.

171
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
Go to the top of this.

172
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
Paste it here.

173
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
Compile it.

174
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
So, as before, the <b>table</b> got placed at the top of this page.

175
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
Let me put some more text here.

176
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
Four copies.

177
00:17:16 --> 00:17:25
So, now what has happened is-

178
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
this table has been floated to the second page and

179
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
there is nothing else here. So, it has been placed at the middle of this page.

180
00:17:35 --> 00:17:42
Let me put one more copy of this, some more text.

181
00:17:43 --> 00:17:48
So, now what has happened is-

182
00:17:49 --> 00:18:00
this is the title page, this is the text page, the table has been floated, it has gone to the top of this page.

183
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
As in <b>equations</b>, we can also create <b>labels</b> and use them for referencing.

184
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
For example,

185
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
you give this <b>command</b> below the <b>caption command</b>.

186
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
You have to give it below the caption command because it is the caption command that creates the <b>table number</b>.

187
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
For example, here 'table 1' has been created automatically by this caption command.

188
00:18:26 --> 00:18:32
If you put the label after this, this label will refer to the number created using the caption command.

189
00:18:33 --> 00:18:39
So <b>label</b>

190
00:18:40 --> 00:18:42
<b>fruits</b>.

191
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
So, let me just go back and say

192
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
let me add this line here.

193
00:18:53 --> 00:19:07
<b>The cost of these fruits is shown in Table reference</b>, you have to give the label, it should be the same as this.

194
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
<b>tab fruits</b>

195
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
Let me compile it.

196
00:19:16 --> 00:19:21
So there it is,On first compilation, this variable is not assigned.

197
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
So let me re-compile it, so now I have got this.

198
00:19:28 --> 00:19:32
We can create a list of tables automatically

199
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
as we explain now.

200
00:19:37 --> 00:19:49
After the <b>make title</b>, suppose we want this <b>list of tables</b> - one word, is the command.

201
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
So what has happened is

202
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
it has created a list of tables.

203
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
Typically one would have to compile twice to make sure the table number comes correct.

204
00:20:03 --> 00:20:12
Here it comes, the table according to this list is in page two but we know that it is in page 3.

205
00:20:13 --> 00:20:14
So, this is in page 3.

206
00:20:15 --> 00:20:19
So, let's go back and compile it once more.

207
00:20:20 --> 00:20:25
So there you are, it is in page 3.

208
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
So this has been explained before.

209
00:20:29 --> 00:20:35
Alright, this comes to the end of this part in which we explained the <b>tables</b>.

210
00:20:36 --> 00:20:47
We will now explain how to create figures using the command called <b>include graphics</b>.

211
00:20:48 --> 00:20:59
So for this, we need to include this package called <b>graphicx</b>.

212
00:21:00 --> 00:21:07
Okay! Suppose I go to the bottom of this,

213
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
and say, the command is as follows. <b>begin figure</b>

214
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
<b>include graphics</b>

215
00:21:19 --> 00:21:28
<b>width</b> equals.

216
00:21:29 --> 00:21:35
I have a file called <b>iitb.pdf</b>.

217
00:21:36 --> 00:21:37
There you are.

218
00:21:38 --> 00:21:50
I include it here with the width of this figure coming out to be equal to that of the line width.

219
00:21:51 --> 00:21:54
Let me end this figure.

220
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
Compile this.

221
00:22:01 --> 00:22:03
There you are.

222
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
So, it has also been put at the top of this page.

223
00:22:09 --> 00:22:16
Alright! What I will do is, let me just, so this is for if I want to use the entire line width .

224
00:22:17 --> 00:22:25
Suppose I want to use point 5, that is half a line width,

225
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
then it has been made small.

226
00:22:29 --> 00:22:31
And note that it has been <b>left aligned</b>.

227
00:22:32 --> 00:22:37
As in the <b>table</b>, I can say <b>centering</b>

228
00:22:38 --> 00:22:48
which will center this at the middle.

229
00:22:49 --> 00:22:59
I can also create a <b>caption</b>; figure captions are created after the figure is included.

230
00:23:00 --> 00:23:12
<b>Golden Jubilee logo of IIT Bombay</b>.

231
00:23:13 --> 00:23:27
Okay, as before I can create a <b>label</b> and refer to it using the <b>ref</b> command.

232
00:23:28 --> 00:23:35
I can also make this list of figures appear along with the list of <b>tables</b>.

233
00:23:36 --> 00:23:44
So, suppose I want list of figures also.

234
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
I will compile it.

235
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
I will compile it twice.

236
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
and there it is. List of figures also comes automatically.

237
00:23:56 --> 00:24:07
All the figure captions will appear here.

238
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
There is one last thing that I want to show you here.

239
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
That is how to rotate these figures.

240
00:24:15 --> 00:24:20
This is done by the <b>angle</b> option.

241
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
Suppose, <b>angle</b>... I want to rotate by 90 degrees.

242
00:24:25 --> 00:24:28
So, let's go to this figure.

243
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
Let’s compile this.

244
00:24:32 --> 00:24:36
So, this has been rotated by 90 degrees.

245
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
Rotate it by 'minus 90'.

246
00:24:42 --> 00:24:47
Alright. So, this is the way to include the figures.

247
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
Here, I am assuming that <b>iitb.pdf</b> is available.

248
00:24:53 --> 00:24:54
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

249
00:24:55 --> 00:25:04
The beginners of latex should compile after every few changes to the <b>source document</b> and make sure that what they have entered is correct.

250
00:25:05 --> 00:25:06
Thank you for listening to this tutorial.

251
00:25:07 --> 00:25:12
This is Kannan Moudgalya, signing off. Good-bye.
